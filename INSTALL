To compile Gargoyle you will need jam 2.5.

For sound support, you will need SDL_mixer.
The FMOD sound support is slightly broken, but can be re-enabled
with a little bit of hacking.

Edit the Jamrules file to suit your system configuration.
Comment out the "USESDL = yes" line if you don't care about
sound support.

Compile with "jam". The default is to build a RELEASE build.

Compile with "jam -sBUILD=DEBUG" for a debuggable build.

The command "jam install" will copy the compiled executables
and shared libraries into "build/dist/".

For a system-wide install, the following four steps should place
the binaries, shared library, and configuration file in appropriate
locations. However, please check the Jamrules file and verify that
the referenced paths actually exist before you proceed.

sudo env SYSTEM=1 jam install
sudo ln -s -f /usr/local/libexec/gargoyle/gargoyle /usr/local/bin/gargoyle
sudo ln -s -f /usr/local/lib/gargoyle/libgarglk.so /usr/lib/libgarglk.so
sudo cp garglk/garglk.ini /etc/garglk.ini

* Building on MacOS: (notes by Andrew Plotkin, Oct 2016)

To create a release build of Gargoyle.app -- one that can be distributed
to other people -- requires some care. After struggling with it for a week,
this is what I have learned:

- You need an Intel Mac with the developer tools (Xcode) installed.
No surprise there.

- You should compile on the oldest MacOS available. You can build on an 
old Mac and get the result to run on new Macs. The reverse is harder; at
least, I failed to make it work.

I did the current build on MacOS 10.7 "Lion". (The Jamfile and other support
files in this package are now set up for 10.7, and the resulting app
runs on 10.7 and up. Unlike previous Gargoyle releases, it does not support 
the PPC architecture.)

- You need to install Unix packages with MacPorts.

Homebrew, sadly, does not support 10.7 any more. (I tried to install the
necessary packages via Homebrew but ran into hopeless package dependency
loops.) Also, Homebrew has a weird install structure which does not
work with the current gargoyle_osx.sh build script.

(Happily, Homebrew and MacPorts can coexist on the same box. I recommend
doing the build in a shell which can only see the MacPorts world: add
/opt/local/bin to your PATH and *remove* /usr/local/bin.)

- Building

To set up your build environment on a fresh Mac, install MacPorts
via https://www.macports.org/install.php. You want the "pkg" installer
for Lion (assuming that's your OS).

Once that's set up, do:

  sudo port install libsdl -x11
  sudo port install libsdl_mixer libsdl_sound
  sudo port install libpng
  sudo port install jpeg
  sudo port install smpeg
  sudo port install freetype
  sudo port install pkgconfig
  sudo port install jam

You can then run the build:

  sh gargoyle_osx.sh

This should create Gargoyle.app, and also build a distributable .DMG file
which contains the app.

- Verifying the build

It's useful to know how to check the app for portableness. If you type a
command like

  otool -L Gargoyle.app/Contents/MacOS/Gargoyle
  otool -L Gargoyle.app/Contents/PlugIns/glulxe

...you will see a list of the dynamic libraries linked into the interpreter.
These may start with

  @executable_path/../Frameworks/...: libs included in Gargoyle.app
  /System/Library/Frameworks/...: MacOS standard libs
  /usr/lib/...: more MacOS standard libs

If you see any lines starting with /opt/local or /usr/local, you have a
problem. That library is trying to load out of MacPorts or Homebrew, and
the interpreter will fail on most other Macs (which do not have those repos
installed).
