Name
  os.h - operating system definitions
Function
  Definitions that vary by operating system
Notes
  Do NOT put your system-specific definitions in this file, EXCEPT for
  your system-specific #include lines.

  We want to avoid piling up a huge tree of #ifdef's, since it's almost
  impossible to decipher such code.  Instead, we want to isolate all of
  the code for each platform in its own header file -- this way, it
  should be easy to figure out what code is compiled on each system.

  So, when porting this code to a new platform, you should first
  create an osxxx.h file for your platform (for example, on Windows,
  the file is oswin.h), then add to this file an ifdef'd include for
  your file, something like this:

    #ifdef _FROBNIX
    #include "osfrobnix.h"
    #endif

  These should generally be the ONLY lines in this file that pertain
  to your system.  Everything else for your system should be defined
  in your osxxx.h file.

  Also note that some definitions belong in your *hardware* file,
  rather than your operating system file.  Since many types of hardware
  have several operating systems, and many operating systems run on
  more than one type of hardware, definitions that pertain to a
  particular type of hardware should be isolated in a separate file.
  So, if you're adding a new hardware platform as well as (or instead
  of) a new operating system, you should create a new h_xxx.h file
  (in the "hardware" source subdirectory), and add an include line
  like this:

    #ifdef _M_BANANA_3000
    #include "h_b3000.h"
    #endif

  Note that you may have to adjust your makefile's CFLAGS so that
  the proper hardware and software configuration is selected via -D
  options (or your local equivalent).
