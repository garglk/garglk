Once again, you, Doug Mittling, got stuck with the crappy travel assignment.
It's the downside of being a middle manager--your engineers were all too busy
with real work, and your vice president had an important fact-finding trip to
Maui, but you had no excuse apart from a big pile of process reports to review.
So here you are, at an anonymous power plant in a mosquito-infested jungle
somewhere in south Asia, the nearest airport a twelve-hour drive away.  You've
been here six weeks already, trying to get this crappy SCU-1100DX working so
you can give the customer a demo, but so far it's still broken.  It's starting
to feel desperate, especially since you've overheard Guanmgon talking about
Mitachron several times recently.  If you lose this contract to Mitachron, your
VP will be furious.  When he gets back from Maui, of course.

Release 2 (QA-TEST-BUILD)

Control Room
This is the cramped control room of Government Power Plant #6.  Even before you
arrived, this room was so stuffed with equipment that it was barely possible to
turn around.  Now that you've added the refrigerator-sized SCU-1100DX to the
mix, the room has about as much open space as the "budget economy class"
airline seat you were wedged into for fifteen hours on the flight here.  The
only exit is west.

You see a circuit tester and a CT-22 diagnostic module here.

Xojo and Guanmgon are standing in the doorway watching you work.

>open back cover
Opening the tester reveals the circuitry inside, including an XT772-LV chip.

Of course!  The DynaTest is just the kind of low-power application where you'd
find an XT772-LV!

A mosquito flies lazily past your head.

You hear the opening notes of Beethoven's Fifth as rendered in piezo-electric
square waves: Guanmgon's cell phone ringing.  He frantically pulls out the
phone, drops it, catches it in mid-air, drops it again, picks it up, pokes at
the keypad, and finally puts it to his ear.  His conversation isn't in English,
so you don't have any idea what's being said, but you can tell it's not good
news.  You'd bet it's his superiors calling for yet another update.  Needless
to say, the bill of goods they were sold didn't include six long weeks just to
get the demo working, and they haven't been hiding their impatience lately.

(Your score has just increased by two points.)

(If you'd prefer not to be notified about score changes in the future, type
NOTIFY OFF.)

>put xt772-lv in ct-22
(first taking the XT772-LV chip, then taking the XT772-HV chip from the S901
socket)
Done.

Guanmgon continues talking on the phone.  More listening than talking,
actually; even without understanding the language, you can tell that every time
he starts to say something he gets interrupted.

>put ct-22 in slot
(first taking the CT-22 diagnostic module)
The module slides into place--not quite smoothly, but at this point it's enough
that it fits at all.  You give it a firm push to make sure the connectors are
all seated properly.  Now all that remains is switching on the SCU, and hoping
there's not yet another problem lurking.

You notice a mosquito land on your arm, and manage to swat it before it can
bite.

Guanmgon fumbles with the phone, almost dropping it, and puts it away.  Xojo
asks him something, and you hear "Mitachron" a couple of times in Guanmgon's
reply, accompanied by heavy sighs.

>turn on scu
You cross your fingers and flip the switch.  The SCU-1100DX clicks and hums as
it starts its power-on self-test sequence.  Many seconds pass.  You hold your
breath.  Guanmgon and Xojo lean in from the doorway, as though there were
something to see.  Then, four short beeps: successful start-up!  You carefully
scan the modules, and see that everything's working.  After six weeks, you've
finally done it; at last, you can give the demo and, hopefully, get a contract
signed.

Guanmgon sees the SCU power up, and squeezes into the room to check the control
boards.  "It is working," he says with amazement.  "This is so wonderful!
Dreadful disgrace is not for us now!  But we must act quickly.  Xojo!  Escort
Mr. Mittling to see the Colonel at once.  Hurry with maximum haste!  Do not
delay!  Quickly, quickly, hurry!"

Xojo nods, then turns to you and indicates the doorway.

A distant creaking sound echoes through the building.

(Your score has just increased by ten points.)

>w
You let Xojo lead the way.

East End of Hallway
Like every other part of the plant structure, this wide fifth-floor hallway is
built entirely of concrete.  The north and south walls are only waist-high,
apart from a few widely-spaced columns supporting the roof, leaving the hallway
open to the jungle to the north and to the cavernous interior of the plant to
the south.  The hall ends in a doorway to the east, and continues to the west.

Xojo holds his hand out to indicate the far end of the hall, and waits for you
to proceed.

>w
You let Xojo lead the way.

West End of Hallway
This wide hallway has waist-high walls open to the jungle to the north, and to
the enormous plant interior to the south; a few widely-spaced columns support
the roof.  The hall ends at an elevator door to the west, and continues to the
east.

Xojo reaches out and pushes the elevator call button.  The neon lamp above the
button lights dimly.

A distant rumbling sound drifts in from somewhere out in the jungle.  At first
you think it's thunder, but it grows a bit louder and you realize it's an
approaching helicopter.  A scan of the horizon shows nothing in the air.
Suddenly the noise is deafening, and a black shape swoops into view from
overhead, racing away toward the buildings across the river.  As the helicopter
flies past, you spot the yellow Mitachron logo on the tail.

>z
Time passes...

The sound of another approaching helicopter drifts in from the jungle, and
within a few moments it appears--along with three others, flying in formation,
heading the same way as the previous one.  The four fly across the river and
land next to the first.

>z
Time passes...

The arrival of the Mitachron people is awfully worrying; they must really want
this deal to have sent such a large group.  At least they'll have to do their
own demo, so you're ahead of them on that count.  Even so, direct competitive
situations with Mitachron never seem to go well for Omegatron.  Maybe if you
can get to the Colonel quickly enough, you'll be able to get your contract
signed before the Mitachron reps even get a meeting with her.

>z
Time passes...

A loud buzzer sounds from the elevator, and the neon lamp above the call button
goes out.

Xojo pulls opens the door and pushes aside the elevator's folding metal gate
for you, and waits for you to get in.

>w
You let Xojo lead the way.

Elevator
This is a big, sturdily-built elevator, like something you'd find in an old
warehouse.  There's been no attempt at decoration; just dull metal walls, a
folding metal gate to the east, a handrail on the back wall, a recessed service
panel in the ceiling, a bare bulb dimly burning at the top corner of the back
wall.  Protruding black buttons are labeled, from the bottom, S2, S1, G, and 2
through 5.  Beyond the gate is the bare concrete of the shaft wall.

Xojo lets the door swing shut and closes the gate, then pushes the "G" button.
The elevator lurches and starts slowly descending.

>z
Time passes...

Xojo clears his throat.  "I was wondering," he says, "if your fine company
might consider myself for a position of employment."  He produces a piece of
paper and holds it out for you.  "My r‚sum‚," he says.  "I would most
appreciate your kind consideration."

The elevator descends past a door marked "4."

(You could ask him about the helicopters, or tell him about the Omegatron
hiring freeze.)

>z
Time passes...

"If anything is unclear on my r‚sum‚," Xojo says, "I would be pleased to
clarify."

The elevator continues its slow descent.

>z
Time passes...

The elevator descends past a door marked "3."

>z
Time passes...

"I would appreciate the opportunity to be considered for opportunities with
your wonderful company," Xojo says.

The elevator continues its lethargic descent.  Rationally, you know that the
few minutes of this elevator ride aren't going to cost you the deal, but that
doesn't stop the irrational part of your brain from pumping out anxiety
hormones.

>z
Time passes...

The elevator descends past a door marked "2."

>z
Time passes...

Xojo looks at you expectantly.

The elevator plods on.  Come on, come on, come on...

>z
Time passes...

Xojo watches you expectantly.

The elevator descends past a door marked "G."  Strange; you thought that was
your stop.

Xojo, looking a little alarmed, starts punching buttons.  "No reason for
panic," he says, not very convincingly, but then he seems to calm down and stop
fooling with the buttons.  "The elevator programming is sometimes faulty.  We
should be halted soon, since the shaft is nearly at bottom."

>z
Time passes...

The elevator continues its slow descent.

>z
Time passes...

The elevator descends past a door marked "S1."

>z
Time passes...

The elevator continues its slow descent.

>z
Time passes...

The elevator descends past a door marked "S2."

Xojo grips the handrail tightly.  "Be firm, the stopping is ready to be
abrupt."  You grab the handrail and brace yourself.

The shaft wall keeps going by for a few more moments, showing no sign of
slowing, then: thud!  Not a jerk from the cable above, but the sharp shock of
hitting something below.  The whole elevator shudders.  Outside the gate, the
shaft wall is suddenly motionless.

"All is safe now," Xojo says, relaxing.  "Now we need do no more than wait
patiently for rescue."

>ask xojo about panel
You point to the service panel.  "Do you think we could get out through that
panel?"

Xojo looks at it appraisingly.  "Perhaps, but the height is too far above for
me to reach it.  Perhaps I could lift you, and you could attempt reaching.
Shall we try?"

>yes
"Okay," you say, "let's give it a try."  Xojo bends down to let you climb onto
his shoulders, which you manage to do with some awkwardness, then he shakily
stands up.  This puts you in easy reach of the ceiling.

"I hope you can see what a high-initiative employee I would be," Xojo says,
straining a bit under your weight.

>open panel
You give the plate a push, and it lifts away easily.  You slide it aside,
leaving a two-by-three foot opening in the ceiling.

>up
You lift yourself through the opening, first propping yourself on your elbows,
then using the leverage to lift the rest of your body.  Just as you're almost
through, you hear the sound of tearing cloth--you realize you managed to snag
the leg of your pants on the edge of the opening, making a huge rip down half
the leg.

Elevator Shaft
The roof of the elevator car doesn't make a very good place to stand, crowded
as it is with mechanical protrusions and cable attachments.  A service hatch
provides access to the elevator's interior.  The main cable hangs limply from
the top of the shaft far above.

To the east is a door marked "S2", just a little above the top of the elevator.

The service hatch cover is lying next to the opening.

You extend your hand to Xojo and help him climb up from the elevator.

(Your score has just increased by five points.)

>put panel in slot
(first taking the metal plate)
You slide the plate into the slot.  You move it up and down a bit, and you feel
it catch on something.  You give it a little tug; with a click, the door
unlatches and pops just a little ajar.  You remove the plate from the slot.

>e
(first opening the door)
You give the door a push and it swings open.  It's spring-loaded, so you have
to hold it open.

You climb the couple of feet over the raised threshold.

West End of Hallway
This is the west end of a dimly-lit corridor.  The hall ends here with an
elevator door to the west, and continues to the east.

You hold the door open for Xojo, then let it swing shut after he comes through.
You hear the door latch as it closes.

"Your plan of escape was conceived and executed with great excellence," Xojo
says.  "The main canyon bridge is unfortunately not accessible from this sub-
basement level, but I know of an alternative crossing.  This way, please."  He
points down the hall.

(Your score has just increased by two points.)

>e
You let Xojo lead the way.

Middle of Hallway
This long, dimly-lit corridor extends to the east and west.  A low, narrow door
leads north.

Xojo opens the door.  "This way, please," he says, indicating the door.

>n
You let Xojo lead the way.

Storage Room
This dark, musty room is packed with boxes, crates, and random junk, jammed
into every available space and stacked precariously from the floor to the low
ceiling.  A narrow path seems to wind through the junk to the north.  A door
leads south.

"The clutter is formidable," Xojo says, "but the way north is passable."

>n
You let Xojo lead the way.  You carefully pick your way through the piles of
junk, but the place is so cramped that you can't avoid getting covered with
dust and cobwebs.

Utility Area
This is the north end of a dark, musty storage room.  Junk is piled almost from
floor to ceiling to the south, except for a narrow path that winds through the
clutter.  This end of the room is mostly cleared of junk, probably to leave
room to access the pipes, conduits, and other utility equipment arrayed near
the north wall.  A round opening in the north wall leads outside; it looks like
it was designed mostly for the pipes and conduits, but there's enough space
left over for a person to fit through.

Xojo points to the opening.  "My apologies, but this is the way for
proceeding," he says.

>n
You let Xojo lead the way.

Utility Platform
This rickety walkway is little more than a steel grating bolted to the outside
of the power plant building, suspended over a six-hundred foot drop into the
canyon below.  The plant wall continues for another twenty feet below, where it
reaches the top of the sheer cliff wall of the canyon.  The canyon wall drops
almost vertically to the river below.

A crude rope bridge over the canyon ends here.  This end of the bridge is tied
to the steel grating of the platform, and the bridge extends out over the
canyon to the north.

Numerous pipes and conduits run up and down the wall of the building.  Many go
in through the round opening in the wall to the south, but there's just enough
space left over for a person to fit through the opening.

A short distance east, the underside of the main bridge across the canyon is
visible.

"Apologies once again," Xojo says, indicating the rope bridge.  "It is
relatively safe, in contrast to appearances."

>n
You take a deep breath and carefully follow Xojo's lead, holding the main
support ropes for balance and hunting around for footing on each step.

South End of Rope Bridge
Standing on this bridge is a lot more difficult than it looked from the
platform.  The whole thing wants to fold up under your weight, and the lattice
of ropes making up the walkway shifts with every step.

Xojo waits for you to catch up.

A sharp vibration shudders through the bridge, as though someone struck one of
the ropes with a hammer.

>n
You let Xojo lead the way.

Middle of Rope Bridge
This is just about halfway across the bridge.  From here, the ends of the
bridge are so far away they're not readily visible, making it almost feel like
the bridge is floating in mid-air over the canyon.

Xojo waits for you to catch up.

The whole bridge abruptly falls about three feet, then stops with a jerk.  Xojo
looks back and laughs nervously.

>n
You let Xojo lead the way.  You think you're starting to get the hang of this,
and you move forward with a little more confidence.  The north end of the
bridge finally comes into sight--not much further now.

The bridge shudders with a sharp shock and twists to the left.  You stop and
hold on tight.  The vibration fades, but the walkway is still at an odd angle,
so you try to shift your weight to right yourself.  Another shudder, and the
bridge twists even more, then drops about six feet and jerks to a stop.  Your
heart pounds and you hang on as tightly as you can.

Xojo looks back.  "Perhaps we should--"

The bridge gives way, and you're in free-fall.  You hang on to the rope out of
reflex, but it's just falling with you.  Maybe not, though: the rope jerks
tight and starts pulling you toward the north face of the cliff.  Suddenly
you're falling sideways rather than down, the north cliff approaching fast.
You brace yourself for impact just before you slam into the cliff wall.

After a couple of bounces, you more or less come to a stop.  You take a look at
yourself, and it doesn't look like you're bleeding.  Maybe you're so drenched
with adrenaline that you don't realize how badly you're hurt yet, but you don't
seem to have any serious injuries; you're undoubtedly a little bruised, but no
major body parts seem broken or missing.  It looks like you lost one of your
shoes, though.

Hanging on a Rope Bridge
What was once a rope bridge is now hanging vertically alongside the north cliff
of the canyon.  Fortunately, the construction of the bridge seems somewhat
usable as a ladder.  It looks like it's only about fifty feet to the top of the
cliff above; the rest of the bridge continues for some distance below.

Xojo is just above, hanging on to the ropes.  "I think we can climb up from
here," he says.

>u
You let Xojo lead the way.  It's a bit of work, but the rope lattice of the
former walkway actually makes a pretty good ladder.  You make it to the top of
the cliff in almost no time, and Xojo helps you up over the edge.

Edge of Canyon
This is a rough area strewn with rocks and overgrown with vegetation.  To the
south, the sheer cliff wall of the canyon drops away almost vertically.  A
little path leading northeast has been cut through the overgrowth.

The end of the rope bridge is anchored to a pair of sturdy metal stakes driven
into the rock.  The bridge itself hangs limply over the edge of the canyon.

Xojo sits on the ground, catching his breath.  "Ha, ha," he forces a laugh.
"Perhaps I should have mentioned.  The senior leaders sometimes find it is
useful to partially cut the ropes anchoring the bridge, as a surprise to those
crossing it.  This reminds Junior Peons of the importance of remaining alert."
He gets to his feet.  "This way," he says, pointing to the path.

>ne
You let Xojo lead the way.  You follow the path through the dense foliage.

Courtyard
A sizable area of jungle has been cleared to form this courtyard.  The vast
main administrative office building wraps around the north and east sides of
the area, and low wooden fences keep the jungle at bay to the south and west.
A narrow path leads southwest into the jungle.  A set of doors to the east
leads into the building.

Several helicopters--you count five--are parked here, rotors still spinning
lazily.  Dozens of people wearing black Mitachron-logo polo shirts are busily
dashing around, many carrying boxes or crates.

Xojo points to the doors into the building.

The Mitachron people are here in force, all right; all of this activity must be
to set up an instant demo.  It's a very good thing you let Xojo take you across
that rope bridge after all; if it had taken any longer to get here, they might
actually have been able to steal this deal away from you.  Luckily, it looks
like you got here in time.

>e
(first opening the administration building doors)
You let Xojo lead the way.

Lobby
On past visits to the administration center, this large, open lobby was quite
austere and utilitarian, but it's been transformed: it's festive, colorful,
almost carnival-like.  The room is crowded with people talking and dancing.
Balloons and confetti fill the air, a live band plays from a stage, tables
spread with food line the walls, waiters weave through the crowd with big trays
of drinks.

A set of doors leads outside to the west.

Xojo taps you on the shoulder.  "Behold, Colonel Magnxi!" he shouts, pointing
to the Colonel.  You hadn't picked her out of the crowd yet, but now you see
her standing nearby.

So this is your chance.  You wish you didn't look like you'd just been hit by a
bus, but this is no time to worry about trivial details such as looking
presentable.  Besides, the Colonel looks a little ridiculous herself--the
military uniform she's wearing is funny-looking enough, but she's worn that
every other time you've met with her.  It's the hat she has on that crosses the
line from eccentric to bizarre.

The music changes to a slower dance song.

>talk to colonel
"Colonel Magnxi!" you shout, trying to be heard over the music, but the brass
section picks just this moment to get really loud.  The Colonel doesn't seem to
hear you.

The tempo of the music slows down a little, and things get a little less noisy.

>again
You push your way through the crowd and wave your arms, shouting a little
louder.  "Colonel!  Colonel Magnxi!"  She looks your way like she actually
heard you this time, but a waiter cuts in front of you.  The waiter moves off,
but Colonel Magnxi is talking to someone else again now.

"Excuse me!" a waiter shouts.  You make enough room for him to get past, and he
moves away through the crowd.

>g
You shout at the top of your lungs.  "Colonel Magnxi!"  Just as you do, the
music stops--your shout echoes through the suddenly quiet room.  Everyone turns
and looks at you.

The Colonel stares at you along with everyone else for a moment, then smiles.
"Oh, how lovely to see you again," the Colonel says in her perfect English
accent.  She squints and wobbles a little, like she's had a bit to drink.
"Mister, um, Mister Muddling, isn't it?  Well, do join us.  We were all just
celebrating our new partnership with the Mitachron Corporation.  Isn't this a
lovely party Mitachron are throwing for us?"

New partnership?  "But, but..." you stutter, not believing what you're hearing.

The band starts a new song, a bit less deafening than the last one.  "And did
you see my brilliant new hat?" she asks, running her fingers around the
oversized brim.  "It's a gift from Mr. Belker here.  Really, Frosst, it's too
much."

Oh, no.  You didn't see him here until just now.  The slight, pale man standing
next to Magnxi is Frosst Belker, a junior executive at Mitachron.  You've
crossed paths with him before, always on occasions just like this.

"Ah, Mr. Mittling," Belker says with that damned smirk of his.  He speaks with
a faint accent you've never been able to place, his vowels a bit elongated and
nasal, his consonants a little too crisply enunciated.  "Again we see there is
no customer you can court which I cannot take away."  He finishes his champagne
and hands the glass to a passing waiter.  "Colonel, a pleasure doing business,
as always.  I must be on my way, but do enjoy the party."  He and the Colonel
embrace like diplomats, and then he turns to go, but he stops for a moment and
looks your way.  "You too, of course, Mr. Mittling," he says with another
smirk, then chuckles and walks off, disappearing into the crowd.

The colonel goes back to mingling.

Xojo taps you on the shoulder and hands you a piece of paper--a print-out from
an old-style line printer, with alternating green and white horizontal stripes
across the page.  "This arrived in the nightly batch of electronic e-mail," he
says.  "I express my sympathy for your unfortunate non-success," he adds.  "I
wish you improvement of fortune for your future endeavors.  Now, I must return
to assist Guanmgon in dismantling your very wonderful SCU-1100DX product."  You
shake hands, and he disappears into the crowd.

The band plays a slightly quieter passage briefly, then the tempo picks up and
they're even louder than before.

>read print-out
It's a print-out from an old-style line printer, printed on continuous fan-fold
paper with alternating stripes of white and pale green.  It's an e-mail message
from your boss; he must be back from Maui.  It's in his distinctive all-lower-
case style; he does that to impress upon people that he's too important to
waste his valuable time pressing the Shift key.  His spelling and punctuation
styles are similarly streamlined.

Great.  You're not even back from this miserable trip yet and you already have

Three weeks later...



The airport shuttle drops you off at the end of San Pasqual St., at the east
edge of the Caltech campus, and drives off.

You'd forgotten how incredibly heinous LA traffic can be.  The 105 was solid
tail-lights all the way from LAX to downtown, and the 110 was a parking lot
most of the way up to Pas.  You had thought you might poke around campus a
little before your appointment, but that's out of the question now; better get
straight to the Career Center Office.  Speaking of which, it seems like they
move the Career Center to a new building every time you're down here; this time
it's in the Student Services building, a short distance up Holliston.

San Pasqual St.
This is the end of a wide residential street.  Parked cars line both sides of
the street, which continues to the east, out into Pasadena.  The street ends
here and becomes a walkway to the west, leading deeper into the campus.  Tall
bushes along the south side of the street partially conceal a wall, which
encloses the rear of the North Houses complex.  Holliston Ave., which ends here
in a T-intersection, continues north.

A brightly-colored sofa and a couple of big potted plants lend some cheer to
this small lobby.  Several doors lead to adjoining rooms: to the north is a

Affairs"; and to the south, "Career Center Office."  A doorway to the west

This room seems to be loosely divided into an office area and a public area.
Several desks are grouped on one side of the room, making up the office area.
On the other side, a couple of couches (one large and one small) are arranged
in an "L" around a square glass coffee table.  A literature rack stands near
the couches.

A door to the north leads out to the lobby.

A woman is sitting at one of the desks, talking on the phone.  She sees you
come in, gives you a little wave, and holds up her index finger in the standard
"just a moment" gesture.

You hear someone coming through the door, and look over to see a slender man in
a white double-breasted jacket and white slacks sauntering into the room.  You
almost groan out loud when you realize that it's none other than Frosst Belker.
You just hope he's not here to interview the same student you are--as tough as
it is to beat them at selling, it's even harder to beat them at hiring.

Belker surveys the room.  He looks at the woman on the phone, then at you, then
smiles--not warmly, not like he's glad to see you, more like he's amused at a
private joke.  "Mr. Mittling," he says with his slight accent, "what a pleasant
surprise.  Our respective employers evidently have similar tastes in
prospective employees as well as in clients.  Let us hope that on this
occasion, your reach is more consonant with your grasp, as it were, than it has
so often proved in our past encounters."

>z
Time passes...

The woman hangs up the phone and walks over to you and Belker, carrying a
manila folder.  She looks the two of you over.  "Would you two be..."  She
searches her folder for a moment, the continues, "Belker and Mittling?"

"Yes, I'm Frosst Belker," Belker says, offering his hand, which she shakes
briskly.

"I'm Ms. Dinsdale," she says, "but you can call me `ma'am.'"  She suddenly
bursts into laughter, literally slapping her knee and throwing her head back,
and then, just as suddenly, she's all business again.  "No, seriously, `Ms.
Dinsdale' will be fine."  She turns to you.  "And you would be Mittling, from
Omegatron?"

>yes
"That's right," you say, shaking her hand.

She looks again at her folder, speaking while flipping through its contents.
"And you both came to see Mr. Stamer, I see."  She looks up and shakes her
head.  "Well," she says in a peevish tone, "don't shoot the messenger, but I'm
afraid Stamer won't be seeing you today.  It seems he had something more
`important' to do, namely Ditch Day.  I don't suppose either of you have ever
heard of that before?"

>yes
"I'm actually an alum," you say.

"Good," Ms. Dinsdale replies.  "I hate explaining things.  Belker, what about
you?"

"This `Ditch Day' would be the tradition wherein the seniors abandon the campus
for the day, yes?  Leaving behind all manner of creative puzzles and challenges
which are known, I believe, as `stacks,' hmm?  Ah, and the underclassmen all
strive to overcome these challenges to gain access to the rooms of the seniors.
Am I informed properly?"

"Yep," Ms. Dinsdale says, "that's basically it."

"So," Belker says, "I take it we are to arrange new appointments with Mr.
Stamer?"

Ms. Dinsdale draws closer, speaks almost conspiratorially.  "Let me tell you,
if I were you, and he pulled something like this with me, I'd flush the little
punk right down the john.  Here, look at this note he left for you and tell me
this isn't the most arrogant thing you've never seen."  She hands a note to
Belker; he reads it quickly and hands it to you.

>read note
Dear Ms. Dinsdale,

Sorry to spring this on you with no notice, but I have an unusual request for
the Mitachron and Omegatron reps.  I'd like to ask them to take a stab at
solving my stack.  If they do, I'll take a job at the winner's company,
assuming they want to make an offer.  Sorry if it seems arrogant of me to want
to interview the interviewers like this, but most of the recruiters I've met so
far weren't technical enough to change a lightbulb.  As you know, I want to
work someplace where I'll be around smart people, and I thought this would be a
good filter.

--Brian (Dabney, room 4)

(You could accept the challenge, or decline the challenge.)

>accept challenge
You hardly have a choice, given Rudy's personal interest in hiring Stamer; even
so, this could be kind of fun.  "Count me in," you tell Ms. Dinsdale.

Belker chuckles.  "I also accept, of course."

She gives you both a shocked look.  "Really?  Well, I think you're both crazy,
but I guess it's your cheesecake.  Stamer lives in Dabney House, room 4.  I
hope you kept the campus maps I sent you because you're not getting new ones."
She slaps her knee again and guffaws.  "No, seriously, we're out of maps.
Anyway.  I think Ditch Day goes until five PM, so you've got a whole day to
blow."  She shakes her head, rolls her eyes, gives you and Belker a little mock
salute, and returns to her desk.

Belker watches her, looking amused.  He finally turns to you.  "It seems we
find ourselves once again in a friendly rivalry."  He pulls a cell phone out of
his pocket and absently keys in a number.  "May the better man prevail, as
always."  With a little nasal chuckle, he turns and heads out the door, talking
into his cell phone.

                                      ***
Brian's Black Box of Mystery

My stack is the black box you see before you.  It controls the door to my room.
All you have to do is figure out how to make the box open the door.

This is a "finesse" stack, which means you're not allowed to use physical force
to break the stack--so no breaking down my door.  You're also not allowed to
force open the black box, or move it, or disturb its external wiring.  Apart
from all that, you can use pretty much any means you like to figure out how the
box works.

I'll give you one hint: electronic test equipment might be helpful.  For your
convenience, I've left a bunch of equipment in my lab (022 Bridge).  You can
help yourself to anything on the shelves on the back wall.  The key to the lab
is on top of the box.

P.S. If there are a couple of non-Techers working on the stack, that's okay.
They're recruiters who came here to interview me, and I invited them to join in
the Ditch Day fun.  One special rule for them: you're allowed as many helpers
as you want and any equipment you want, but everything you use has to be on-
campus.  It wouldn't be fair to just phone it in from headquarters.
                                      ***

the recruiters?"

"Yeah," you answer.  "He's with Mitachron.  I'm Doug, from Omegatron."

"Greetings, Doug from Omegatron," the guy with the frizzy hair says.  "I'm
Aaron."

"Me, too," the young woman says, "only I spell it E-R-I-N."  She takes
something out of her pocket and shows it to you: a key.  "I've got the key to

people are studying at this university?"

"We're both double-E's--electrical engineers," Erin says.

"Then surely you have encountered the Pauli principle of exclusion," he says.
Erin and Aaron look at each other, confused.  "The principle that allows
semiconductors to function and makes all modern electronics possible?  Well.  I
mention this because it seems we have our own exclusion principle of sorts.  In
our case, it is not electrons that interest us but we several persons, who will
presently find it difficult to occupy the same space while working on the
same... stack.  This is why I would like to offer you a certain sum, merely for
finding another stack to pursue.  There are many, I understand."

Erin looks insulted.  "You think you can just buy us off?"

Belker uses his shoulder to pin the cell phone to his ear and reaches into his
pocket, taking out a wad of cash.  "It is more of the nature of a token in
recompense," he says.  "A collection of large equipment will be arriving
presently, which will make this hallway cramped and unpleasant.  My offer is by
way of apology for the inconvenience I am sure to cause.  Perhaps a fair amount
would be, hmm, five dollars?"

Aaron and Erin look at each other incredulously.  "Five dollars?"  Erin asks.

"Five dollars each, of course."

"Whoa!" says Aaron.

The two happily accept the money and start to leave, but Erin abruptly halts,
turns around, and takes out a key.  "I guess I won't be needing this," she

obstacle course fills the floor: little orange traffic cones, sheet metal half-
cylinders serving as tunnels, wooden ramps.  Everything is about the right
scale for a Chihauhau, although given the sign outside, it must be for pint-
sized robots.

A small toy car is lying on the floor at one corner of the obstacle course;
someone must have been driving it around the course for fun.  Next to it is a
little box that must be its remote control.

Thomas Lobby
This wide, high-ceilinged entryway is paneled in dark wood, making it feel a
little gloomy.  Doors lead off the lobby to the east and west, and a wide
double door leads outside to the south.

A hand-written sign taped to the east doorway reads "Robotics Competition,"
with an arrow pointing east.

>s
West Olive Walk
The olive walk runs east and west here through a broad lawn flanked by academic
buildings.  On the north side is the beige, rectilinear expanse of Thomas.
Firestone, to the southeast, and Guggenheim, to the southwest, are joined
together by a second-story bridge over the wide gap between them; a paved
walkway leads south under the bridge.

>w
Rock Garden
The walkway winds its way through a rock garden set within a terraced series of
ponds.  The path ascends the hillside to the west, and leads to the Olive Walk
to the east.  A distance off to the west, you can see the Millikan library
towering above.

>w
Millikan Pond
The nine-story obsidian tower of the Millikan Library is to the west, rising
above the wide rectangular pond that fills the large open area north of the
walkway.  A combination abstract sculpture and fountain in the center of the
pond shoots several streams of water into the air.

Bridge Lab is a short distance to the south, and the entrance to the library is
to the west.  A path leads east, down a hill.

Bridge Lab Entryway
This entry hall reflects the different sense of proportion architects had in
the 1920s: it's a bit too narrow and a bit too tall to the modern eye.  At the
south end of the hall, stairs lead up and down, and a doorway at the north end
leads outside.  A display case is set into the east wall.

>d
Basement Hall
It's just the basement, but this hallway has an almost oppressively
subterranean feel, as though it were buried deep underground: the air is damp
and musty, the lighting dim, the slightly-arched ceiling so low that you can't
quite stand up straight.  The hall continues west, and ends to the east in a
stairway leading up, back to the land of the surface dwellers.

A door labeled 021 leads south, and another numbered 022 leads north.  The hall
continues to the west.

Lab 022
Improvised equipment is packed into this small lab, which feels a bit like an
underground parking garage thanks to the low ceiling and concrete surfaces.
The room is dominated by a big steel lab bench roughly in the center of the
lab, and pieces of equipment are arrayed around the bench and along the walls.
A set of shelves on the back wall are laden with yet more equipment.

On the lab bench are a pocket calculator and a report folder.

>get signal generator
(first putting the bookstore receipt in the tote bag to make room, then putting
the plush rat toy in the tote bag to make room)
You start to lift the signal generator off the shelf, but it gets stuck on
something.  You feel around the sides and find some tangled cords, and finally
manage to get the signal generator free.  As you pull it away from the shelf,
you notice a small white ball, connected to a blue cable, dropping onto the
shelf.

>read report
"Spin Decorrelation and Bulk Matter Decoherence Isolation - DRAFT."  It seems
to be a recent draft of a research paper that Stamer's lab group is working on.

You make it about halfway into the abstract before you realize you have no idea
what it's about.  You flip through the paper a bit, but the only thing you
really remember about quantum physics is some stuff about semiconductor band-
gaps from EE 11.

At the back are a bunch of bibliographic references that mostly look as
intimidating as the paper itself, although a couple are called out as
"introductory": a paper in the journal Quantum Review Letters number 70:11c, an
article in Science & Progress magazine number XLVI-3, and a chapter in a
textbook, Introductory Quantum Physics by Bl”mner.

>pull wire
(the network cable)
You pull the wire away from the wall plate, not hard enough to break it but
enough to take up any slack in the behind-the-wall wiring.  You pull it a
couple of inches, and a little paper tag wrapped around the wire pops out from
behind the wall plate.  You get a couple more inches of wire before the runs
out of slack.

>read tag
The bright green tag is marked with the digits 3349-2016.  You can also make
out faint, tiny type on the edge reading "NIC."  The tag is folded over the
wire and glued in place with a strong adhesive.

Basement Hall
It's just the basement, but this hallway has an almost oppressively
subterranean feel, as though it were buried deep underground: the air is damp
and musty, the lighting dim, the slightly-arched ceiling so low that you can't
quite stand up straight.  The hall continues west, and ends to the east in a

A door labeled 021 leads south, and another numbered 022 leads north.  The hall
continues to the west.

Basement Hall West
The low, dimly-lit hallway ends here and continues to the east.  On the south
side of the hall is a door labeled 023, and on the north side another labeled
024.  At the west end of the hall, a very narrow, steep stairway leads down
into shadow.

Sub-basement Hall
The ceiling in this short hallway is too low for you to stand up straight, and
the walls are just unpainted concrete.  It would be too cruel to put anyone's
office down here--even grad students--so this sub-basement is used mainly for
storage and the building's systems.  The hall is piled with junk, evidently
overflow from the storage rooms.  Faded lettering on the north door reads
"Electro-Mechanical," and the east and south doors are unlabeled.  To the west,
a steep stairway leads up.

Wiring Closet
When you were a student, you helped wire a couple of the Bridge labs for a
primitive computer network, which involved pulling a bunch of garden-hose-sized
cables through the walls and connecting them to a bank of transponder boxes in
this wiring closet.  All of that has been long since ripped out and replaced
with more modern phone-style wiring.

A door leads south, out to the hall.

>x wires
There's a huge mass of wires here, mostly along the north wall, coming into the
room through small openings in the ceiling and walls.  The wires are in
numerous colors: blue, red, white, yellow, orange, green.  One blue wire stands
out, because it's been pulled tight--you can see it's the one you tugged on
upstairs.

>x blue wire
It's a blue network cable, pulled tight so that it stands by itself in front of
the mass of wire.  Like many of the other wires, it threads in through an
opening in the ceiling.  You trace the wire through the mass of cabling to see
where it's connected, and find that it disappears into a tiny hole drilled in
the north wall.

Storage Room
This is a huge storage area, mostly for old furniture: the room is stacked with
desks, file cabinets, bookcases.  Cardboard boxes are also piled here and
there, and a bunch of scrap wood is leaning against the wall in the northwest
corner of the room.  A door leads out to the west.

You manage to shove the pile of wood a couple of feet over, which reveals a
door leading north.  You move the wood far enough to clear the way to the door.

Steam Tunnel at Door
This is a section of steam tunnel running east and west past a door, which
leads out of the tunnel to the south.  Pipes and conduits run along the walls,
and bare, low-wattage light bulbs are spaced every ten feet or so along the
ceiling, providing just enough light to see by.

One of the pipes vibrates visibly for a few moments.

Sloping Tunnel
This section of tunnel runs east and west, sloping sharply down to the east.
The steam pipes follow the slope of the tunnel.

It seems to be getting a little warmer.

Bend in Tunnel
The steam tunnel turns a corner here, continuing to the north and to the west.
The pipes and conduits running in from each branch of the tunnel intersect,
some making the turn and others continuing straight on through the walls.

T-Intersection
Two steam tunnels meet here, forming a T: one tunnel runs north and south, and
another tunnel continues off to the east.

>put rat on car
(first taking the plush rat toy from the tote bag)
The plush rat's hand opening fits nicely over the toy car, leaving the wheels
sticking out just enough to let it drive around.

A deep rumbling reverberates briefly through the tunnel.

>drop car

Dropped.

A wave of hot, dry air blows past.

>move joystick east
(first taking the remote control from the tote bag)
You nudge the joystick east.  The toy car zips out of the room to the east.

You hear girlish shrieking from nearby, then a worker comes running down the
tunnel in a panic.  He practically crashes into you, but stops and grabs you by
the arms.  "Rat!" he shouts at you.  "Huge, ugly, mean!  It's not safe down
here!"  He lets you go and continues running, disappearing down the tunnel.

>east
Bottom of Shaft
A column of sunlight spills in from a shaft above, piercing the gloom of the
tunnel.  A ladder built into the wall ascends into the shaft.  The tunnel
continues west, and descends a few concrete steps to the east.

Several big wooden spools of wire are piled up along the tunnel wall.  An
overstuffed three-ring binder is on the floor next to the spools.

You see a toy car (disguised as a rat) here.

You hear a worker above call down.  "Hey, Plisnik, what's going on down there?"
His voice becomes taunting.  "You see a rat or something?"  He chuckles.

Something creaks and groans overhead.

>yes
"Yeah, a big, ugly one, but he's gone now," you say, hoping they don't notice
it's not Plisnik's voice.  You hear the workers above laugh and laugh.

A sharp clang sounds right beside you, as though someone smacked one of the
pipes with a wrench.

>ask for network analyzer
"Hey, can you hand down the Netbisco?" you call up to the workers above.

One of them reaches down into the shaft, lowering the network box.  "Watch out,
Plisnik," he says.  "I think I saw a rat inside it earlier.  Har!  Har!"

As you open the binder, a dingy sheet of paper falls out and flutters to the
floor.

The binder is stuffed with paper.  Flipping through, it seems to be a
collection of official Network Installer Company "Work Order" forms.  You
sample a few at random, and find they're all pretty much the same: install
network port wiring for office X in building Y.  These guys must have a
contract to rewire the whole campus, from the looks of it.  The forms seem to
be sorted in order of the Job Number stamped at the top of each form, so it'd
be easy to look up a specific one given the number.

Narrow Tunnel
The steam tunnel is quite narrow here; it widens a bit to the east and west.

You notice a tiny point of light in the south wall--a small hole, almost hidden
behind one of the big steam pipes.  You never would have noticed it, except
that you have the sense this spot is roughly aligned with the wiring closet.

Something creaks and groans overhead.

T-Intersection
This is a T-intersection, with a north-south tunnel meeting another tunnel
continuing east.  The pipes are arranged in an elaborate network of crossings,
some going straight past the intersection, others turning the corner.

Dim Tunnel
The lights must be spaced out a little more widely than usual here, because
this section of north-south tunnel seems especially dark.  You can make out a

until you're sure one of the pipes is about to burst, but it goes right past

>x wire
The wire is concealed behind one of the large pipes.  It follows the pipe to
the north, but it seems to disappear to the south.  You trace it carefully, and
discover that it goes into an opening low in the west wall.  The opening is
well concealed in shadows under the pipes; you wouldn't even have seen it if
you hadn't been following the wire.

>w
You crouch down on the floor and crawl into the opening head-first.  It's an
uncomfortably tight squeeze, but you manage to work your way through the eight
feet or so of the passage, finally emerging into another tunnel.

Dead End
You spent a lot of time exploring the steam tunnel system during your years
here as a student, but you don't think you've encountered this section before.

The steam tunnel from the south reaches a dead end here; it widens slightly at
the northeast corner, creating a shadowy nook a couple of feet deep.  On the
west side of the tunnel is a door labeled "Supplies."  A small opening low on
the east wall leads into a crawlspace.

You notice a blue wire partially concealed behind the steam pipes.

It seems to be getting a little warmer.

(Your score has just increased by ten points.)

>stand in shadow
You step into the nook's shadows.

>z
Time passes...

Someone on the other side of the door opens it slightly.  You hear a male voice
say, "Come on, let's go."

>z
Time passes...

A sharp clang sounds right beside you, as though someone smacked one of the
pipes with a wrench.

The door opens fully and two workers in bright green overalls step out, closing
the door behind them.  You pretend you're in a spy film and press yourself
against the wall, hiding behind some steam pipes near the corner.  Which seems
to work--the two don't seem to notice you.  They shut the door and head south
down the tunnel.  After a few steps, you hear one of them say "Hang on, I
forgot something."  You watch from behind the cover of the pipes as the smaller
guy returns to the door and enters a combination, which you manage to make out:
5-7-2-1-2.  He slips into the room for a moment, then he's back, closing the
door behind him.  The two head south; you hear their steps recede down the
tunnel.

>z

One of the pipes vibrates visibly for a few moments.

>enter 57212 on lock keypad

You push the buttons in sequence: 5-7-2-1-2.  The mechanism in the keypad
clicks with each button push.

The lock mechanism clicks and whirs, and the door swings open.

Network Room
The door outside is labeled "Supplies," but that's apparently out of date; it
looks like this is actually being used as a network control room.  The room is
dominated by a floor-standing network router box, connected to which are
hundreds of orange, white, and yellow network cables.  The cables are gathered
into giant bundles the size of fire hoses, which feed into conduits leading out
through the walls.

A lone blue network cable comes in through a small hole in the wall next to the
door, which leads out of the room to the east.

(Your score has just increased by five points.)

>x blue wire
The blue wire is threaded through a small hole in the wall, next to the door.
It joins into one of the big bundles of cables--but it's the only blue wire, so
it's easy to follow it to the router box, where it terminates in one of the
router sockets.

There's obviously no way to trace the blue wire's physical connection any
further; the router must connect to the main campus network, so the camera is
effectively connected to every computer on campus.  The only way to trace it
from here would be to hook up a network analyzer and see where the data packets
are going.

>x router
It's a big piece of equipment, the size of a tall bookcase.  Hundreds of
network wires are connected to sockets arrayed across the front of the box.
One one side is a multi-prong diagnostic jack.

This wide passageway opens onto a courtyard to the east, and to the west leads
out of the house to the Orange Walk.  A dimly-lit hallway leads into the house
to the north; painted on the wall alongside the hallway is the legend "1-9".

Courtyard
This large interior courtyard is dominated by what looks to be a papier-mƒch‚
scale-model mountain: a two-story edifice of cliffs and boulders, rising in the
center of the courtyard to a peak higher than the surrounding courtyard walls.
Piled randomly around the base are metal canisters marked with radiation
warnings, many split open and leaking green goo.

This must all be a decoration for a recent multi-house party.  It's pretty
remarkable; back in your day, the Darbs couldn't usually be bothered to pick a
theme for those parties, much less implement one, much less so elaborately.

The courtyard itself follows the Mediterranean style of the south houses: red
brick floor, stucco walls, casement windows, columns supporting an arcaded
overhang to the east, terra cotta tiles on the gently-sloped roofs.  Under the
overhang, doors lead east into the lounge.  The alley 3 entrance is to the
southwest, and alley 5 is to the southeast.  A small alcove lies to the south.
To the west is a breezeway leading outside, and a long concrete stairway goes
up.

Pinball Room
You don't know what this small room off the courtyard was originally intended
for, but to you it's the pinball room, since there was always an old 1960s-
vintage pinball machine or two in here.  It looks like they've finally gotten
with the 80s: in place of a pinball machine is Positron, a classic video game.

The courtyard is outside, to the north.

A yellow note reading "Out of Order" is on the Positron display.

You find the chapter Stamer mentioned and start reading.

Going through the material, you find you actually do remember a fair amount of
it.  All that bizarre stuff about how subatomic particles act like both waves
and particles at the same time, how a particle can be in a "superposition" of
several states at once, how a property of a particle isn't determined until
someone measures it.  You skip over the equations, but you still manage to get
a qualitative grasp of the concepts.

The chapter ends with a discussion of the philosophical questions that QM
raises.  One big mystery is the strange duality of nature: that systems
sometimes behave according to quantum mechanics, and sometimes according to
classical mechanics.  Even the same system behaves both ways: a quantum system
has its strange quantum behavior, where its reality is just a probability
distribution--but only until someone measures the system's properties.
Measuring a property of the system "collapses the wavefunction," turning it
into a classical, deterministic system.  "The quantum mechanics stridently
defies our intuition," Herr Professor Bl”mner writes, "but it is only our human
arrogance that allows us to expect it should be otherwise.  For why should our
intuition, evolved to interpret the decidedly non-quantum phenomena of the
primitive environment of our ancestors, have any application in this exotic
realm?  We must learn ruthlessly to crush this inner protest, to bend our
intuition to the iron will of Nature."

>read 70:11c
You flip past a bunch of papers that look impenetrable, finding the one
mentioned in Stamer's paper: "Decoherence Tolerance in Quantum Computation."
It's by another Caltech research group.

The article isn't exactly light reading.  It's about some of the problems
involved in building quantum computers--computers that exploit the ability of a
quantum system to be in many states at once to quickly perform calculations
that are extremely slow on conventional computers.  One of the biggest
practical problems in building quantum computers, the article explains, is the
difficulty of isolating a quantum system well enough that it will remain a
quantum system long enough to finish its calculation.  If the system isn't
isolated well enough, interactions with its environment will cause
"decoherence," destroying the quantum effects.  Even more problematic is the
self-interaction that results from scaling up a quantum computer to the point
where it can perform useful real-world calculations: the computer's quantum
elements actually start interacting with one another strongly enough to cause
decoherence.

The bulk of the article proposes some ways of working around the self-
interaction problem, by adopting some of the features of conventional computers
that make them more fault-tolerant.  One proposal is to encode information in
the quantum state using error-correcting codes, so that a loss of coherence in
one part of the system can be compensated for by the other parts.  Another
proposal--and this one catches your eye, because Stamer's paper had this in the
title--is that "spin decorrelation" can be used to partially isolate the system
internally and from its environment.  The paper starts in with dense math at
that point, so you mostly skim over the rest.

You scan through this issue and find the article referenced in Stamer's paper:
"Beyond Copenhagen: The Quantum/Classical Transition."

The article is about a nagging weakness in the "Copenhagen Interpretation" of
quantum mechanics.  You hadn't heard the term before, but apparently it refers
to the mainstream QM model, which is essentially what you learned in Ph 2.  A
key part of the Copenhagen doctrine is the idea that a quantum system evolves
in its bizarre quantum way until someone observes the system, at which point
the quantum-mechanical wavefunction "collapses" and the system becomes
classically deterministic.  The problem, it seems, is that there's no rigorous
definition of what it means to "observe" the system.

"One idea is that a conscious observer is required, but most scientists don't
like this one because it just replaces one ill-defined term with an even iller-
defined one, and anyway, it smells like metaphysics.  The mainstream view is
that interaction with `bulk matter' is what constitutes a measurement.  That at
least sounds like a solid, no-nonsense, scientific definition, but it's still a
bit of a dodge: are we talking a dozen atoms or a quadrillion?  No one can say.
And numerous recent experiments call into question the whole idea by showing
that certain exotic kinds of large ensemble systems can exhibit quantum
behavior for prolonged periods, so mere `bulk' can't be the key."

The article points out that most scientists are willing to live with one fuzzy
definition in a theory so empirically successful, but a few physicists find it
troubling enough to look for a better answer to this key question.  The article
surveys some of the proposed alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation,
with names like Many Worlds, Hidden Variables, and Transactional.  It also
talks about some promising recent work that frames the quantum/classical
transition in terms of "decoherence" of the wavefunction.  This idea is based
on wave theory that came out of the invention of the laser; it says that
quantum systems turn into classical systems when their wavefunctions interact
in specific ways with the wavefunctions of other systems, which causes the
wavefunctions to lose their coherence--their ability to superpose multiple
quantum states at once.

You feel like you're starting to catch on to some of the ideas in Stamer's
research report.  You make a mental note to go back and read the report again
in more detail, when you have the time.

>read report
"Spin Decorrelation and Bulk Matter Decoherence Isolation - DRAFT."  It seems
to be a recent draft of a research paper that Stamer's lab group is working on.

Parts of the paper are well beyond your grasp of the subject, but all of the
background reading you've done actually lets you follow a lot of the material.
Stamer's group is apparently working on a way to prevent a quantum system from
"decohering," not only when it comes into contact with its surroundings, but
when parts of the system itself interact with one another.  According to the
paper, they've successfully suppressed decoherence for a matter of seconds at a
time throughout tens of grams of material--apparently quite stunning results in
a realm more typically numbered in femtoseconds and picograms.  They hope to
use this to create large-scale quantum computers built out of ordinary
components.

At the end are some bibliographic references, including the "introductory"
material you've already seen: a paper in the journal Quantum Review Letters
number 70:11c, an article in Science & Progress magazine number XLVI-3, and a

You find Stamer's group's paper: "Applications of Nondecohering Heterogeneous
Bulk Ensembles."

The paper talks about a number of possible applications of decoherence
suppression, but the main thrust is that it could provide a whole new approach
to building quantum computers.

"In principle, if we are successful in suppressing decoherence in bulk matter,
we could create an effectively quantum computer as a superposition of states of
an ordinary computer, such as a PC, or even a pocket calculator...  Of course,
special algorithms would need to be designed for such a device.  The
computation must consist of a series of unitary transformations.  In the final
state vector, the components representing incorrect results must cancel out,
and the correct result must reinforce via constructive interference...  Mapping
a conventional algorithm to our hybrid quantum-conventional computer is
surprisingly straightforward, as we'll show..."

The article goes through an extended example, showing how to use the technique
to find the prime factors of a large integer.  The number theory is a bit
beyond you, but what's interesting is how simple the program is; it's just a
series of simple arithmetic steps that would take a matter of seconds to run,
in quantum mode.  On an ordinary computer, of course, factoring large integers
takes enormous amounts of time.  "This technique isn't limited to prime
factorization," the paper adds.  "The methods we've shown here could be equally
well applied to other conventionally superpolynomial-time problems: discrete
logarithms, Hovarth functions, etc."

to the east.  A distance off to the west, you can see the Millikan library
towering above.

>e
West Olive Walk
The olive walk runs east and west here through a broad lawn flanked by academic
buildings.  On the north side is the beige, rectilinear expanse of Thomas.
Firestone, to the southeast, and Guggenheim, to the southwest, are joined
together by a second-story bridge over the wide gap between them; a paved
walkway leads south under the bridge.

>e
Quad
This open lawn area is known as the Quad, for its rectangular shape.  Several
walkways meet here: the Olive Walk leads east and west, the Orange Walk leads
down a few steps to the south, and another walkway leads north.  To the
northwest is the campus bookstore.  The two main student house complexes lie a
short distance to the east: the North Houses on the north side of the Olive
Walk, and the older South Houses on the south side.

Alongside the Olive Walk, a couple of workers are standing by an open
rectangular manhole, which they've cordoned off with yellow "Caution" tape
strung around some stakes in the ground.  Several big spools of wire are piled
up next to the manhole.

>s
Orange Walk
This north-south walkway is named for the orange trees planted alongside.  A
few steps ascend to the north.  To the south, the walkway ends at California
Boulevard, which forms the southern limit of the campus.  An unpaved path
through the orange trees leads west.  To the east, a passage leads into Dabney
Hovse.

>e
Breezeway
This wide passageway opens onto a courtyard to the east, and to the west leads
out of the house to the Orange Walk.  A dimly-lit hallway leads into the house
to the north; painted on the wall alongside the hallway is the legend "1-9".

>e
Courtyard
This large interior courtyard is dominated by what looks to be a papier-mƒch‚
scale-model mountain: a two-story edifice of cliffs and boulders, rising in the
center of the courtyard to a peak higher than the surrounding courtyard walls.
Piled randomly around the base are metal canisters marked with radiation
warnings, many split open and leaking green goo.

The courtyard itself follows the Mediterranean style of the south houses: red
brick floor, stucco walls, casement windows, columns supporting an arcaded
overhang to the east, terra cotta tiles on the gently-sloped roofs.  Under the
overhang, doors lead east into the lounge.  The alley 3 entrance is to the
southwest, and alley 5 is to the southeast.  A small alcove lies to the south.
To the west is a breezeway leading outside, and a long concrete stairway goes
up.

>s
Pinball Room
You don't know what this small room off the courtyard was originally intended
for, but to you it's the pinball room, since there was always an old 1960s-
vintage pinball machine or two in here.  It looks like they've finally gotten
with the 80s: in place of a pinball machine is Positron, a classic video game.

The courtyard is outside, to the north.

A yellow note reading "Out of Order" is on the Positron display.

>open positron
(first putting Science & Progress issue XLVI-3 in the tote bag to make room,
then taking the keyring from your pocket, then unlocking the service
compartment)
Opening the service compartment reveals a brown paper sack.

Several large circuit boards are inside the compartment.

>turn it on
You flip the switch, but there's no obvious effect.

>attach scope to board
(first putting Quantum Review Letters number 73:9a in the tote bag to make
room, then putting the Electronics Lectures textbook in the tote bag to make
room, then taking the oscilloscope from the tote bag, then putting it on the
floor, then turning it on)
(Note that you can't permanently attach the scope to anything, since its needle
tip only allows momentary contact with the circuit you're probing.)

Since the game's display isn't showing anything, you decide to start with the
video amplifiers.  It would be nice to have a set of schematics, but you figure
it's actually better practice for Stamer's stack without them.

You probe around a little with the scope, but it's been a while since you
looked at a video amp in this much detail.  Maybe if you spent a little time
reading about video amps in the lab manual, you'd have a better idea how to
proceed.

>read about video amps in lab manual
You find a whole lab exercise on video amps.  You go through it carefully,
refreshing your memory on how these things work.  You reach the end of the
section, feeling that you have a good idea how to handle this kind of circuit
now.

>attach scope to board
(Note that you can't permanently attach the scope to anything, since its needle
tip only allows momentary contact with the circuit you're probing.)

You go back and look at the video amplifiers again.  You carefully step through
the video amp circuits, and after a bit you're convinced that they're okay and
that the problem lies elsewhere.

The next thing to check is probably the main logic board.  You identify the CPU
as a 1A80.  You built a few projects with these many years ago, but you
certainly don't remember all the little details of pin layout and so forth, so
you'll need to look up the 1A80 in the lab manual before you can test the logic
board properly.

>read about 1a80
(in the lab manual)
You find a pretty good section on the 1A80, with details on the pin-outs and
electrical characteristics.  This is a very simple chip by modern standards,
and it doesn't take you long to reacquaint yourself with it.

>attach scope to board
(Note that you can't permanently attach the scope to anything, since its needle
tip only allows momentary contact with the circuit you're probing.)

You look again at the main logic board.  You check around the CPU.  After a bit
of probing, it becomes apparent that the problem is on the clock signal coming
into the CPU, and once you know that, you quickly identify a bad part, which is
probably the source of the problem: a crystal with the faded marking
"9.8304MHZ," indicating its frequency.

The crystal will need to be replaced with a working one.  Fortunately, it's not
soldered into the board--it's in a socket for easy replacement.

>look for good 9.8304MHz crystal in bag
You sift through the parts for a few moments, coming across a brand new-looking
9.8304 MHz crystal, which you take.

>put good crystal in socket
(first taking the old 9.8304 MHz crystal from the socket X-7)
You turn off the Positron game first, to make sure you don't damage any parts.

Done.

>turn on positron
You flip the switch, and a power-up test screen gradually fades in on the
display.  After a few moments, the display switches to the game's "attract
mode."

That must have done the trick!  You fiddle with the internal controls to give
yourself a free game, and you start playing.  The aliens quickly clobber you,
but it looks like everything's working properly.

Courtyard
This large interior courtyard is dominated by what looks to be a papier-mƒch‚
scale-model mountain: a two-story edifice of cliffs and boulders, rising in the
center of the courtyard to a peak higher than the surrounding courtyard walls.
Piled randomly around the base are metal canisters marked with radiation

Breezeway
This wide passageway opens onto a courtyard to the east, and to the west leads
out of the house to the Orange Walk.  A dimly-lit hallway leads into the house
to the north; painted on the wall alongside the hallway is the legend "1-9".

>n
Alley One South
Some of the other houses give fanciful names to their alleys, but for some
reason the Darbs never bothered; they just refer to their alleys by number,
this one being Alley One.  Room 1 is to the east and room 2 to the west; the
hallway continues north, and a doorway leads south.

The walls are heavily adorned with graffiti, as they were when you were a
student here.

>n
Alley One North
Alley One ends here in a stairway leading up.  Room 3 is to the east and room 4
is to the west.  The hallway continues south.

Next to the door to room 4 is a small table, on which is a black metal box that
looks like it could once have been a microwave oven.  A sign (really just a
sheet of paper) is fastened to the door above the box.

A huge machine reminiscent of a 1960s mainframe computer nearly blocks the
hall, leaving barely enough space to get past.  Several technicians are busily
operating it.

Belker is slowly pacing back and forth, supervising the technicians as they
operate the test equipment.

Belker gets out his phone, says a few words into it, and returns it to his
pocket.

>read morgen
You open the book and start reading.  At first it seems a little heavy on the
math, but as you get further into it you start to recognize the standard
building blocks--Fourier series, Laplace transforms, PDE's.  You're pleased to
find that the concepts and the math are less distant in your memory than you'd
thought.

You keep reading, skimming over some parts but slowing down to digest others.
Eventually, your eyes start glazing over a bit, and you realize that you've
been standing here reading for quite a while.  You decide you've absorbed just
about as much theory as you can for the moment; what you really need now is
something a little more hands-on.  You notice in the book's front matter a
reference to an accompanying lab manual by E.J. Townsend; that might be worth
looking at.

A technician holds out a wand-like apparatus connected by a thick cable to the
MegaTester, running it slowly around the outside of the black box.  After a
couple of passes around the box, he returns to the MegaTester and puts away the
wand.

>attach signal generator to black box
(first putting the keyring in your pocket to make room, then putting the
Introductory Quantum Physics textbook in the tote bag to make room, then taking
the signal generator from the tote bag, then putting it on the small table)
Done.

"Clear!" someone shouts.  The technicians all rush to the end of the hall and
huddle with their backs to the MegaTester, which is making a sound like a jet
engine starting up.  The sound abruptly stops, and nothing happens for several
moments, then the hall fills with a flash of blinding light for an instant.
Everything seems to turn dark blue with yellow spots.  You blink and squint,
and your vision gradually returns to normal, by which time the technicians are
back at their stations like nothing happened.

>turn on signal generator
You switch on the signal generator.  You try a few settings, but there's no
obvious response from the black box.  An oscilloscope would probably help to
see if anything's going on.

A couple of the technicians tending the MegaTester switch places, forcing them
to squeeze past each other in the narrow space alongside the machine.

>attach scope to black box
(first putting the oscilloscope on the small table)
You're eager to take another look at the black box now that you've had a chance
to reacquaint yourself with this stuff.  You make some adjustments on the scope
and pick up the probe.

Just as you're about to connect the probe, the entire alley fills with a
blinding blue-white light and a deafening crash.  A wave of pressure hits you
and slams you against the wall.  You reach out for something to hold on to for
balance, but find nothing; you feel yourself stumbling sideways, your ears
ringing, your eyes filled with dark green blotches, and you have the sensation
of being caught in a stampede, of trying to push your way through a crowd
rushing in the opposite direction.

As the after-images start to fade from your eyes, you see that you've somehow
made your way out to the breezeway outside Alley One, along with the Mitachron
technicians.  Thick black smoke billows out from the alley entrance.

Frosst Belker emerges nonchalantly from the cloud of smoke, brushing bits of
ash off his white clothes.  At the same time, a group of fire fighters rush in
from the Orange Walk.  They see Belker, talk to him briefly, then rush into the
alley.  As they leave, you notice the Mitachron logos on their uniforms.

Belker turns to you.  "This building," he says, flicking a bit of ash from his
lapel, "it is not, er, `up to code,' you might say.  Not to worry, though.  I
am assured that repairs will be complete within the hour."  He glances at his
watch.  "Ah, just enough time for lunch."  He points his finger around the
crowd of technicians, snaps his fingers, and points outside.  The technicians
all file out, and Belker follows.

>e
As you're leaving, Aaron and Erin come in from the courtyard.  Aaron goes to
check out the smoke, and Erin stops you for a moment.  "We're about to go have
lunch," she says.  "You should join us, if you feel like it."  The two head
across the courtyard toward the dining room.

Lounge
This large common room is essentially the Hovse's living room.  It must have
been necessary to clear the courtyard to make room for the mountain, because
the piles of junk normally out there seem to be in here.  Several couches are
shoved together near the fireplace to make room for the heaps of stuff filling
the south side of the room.  The courtyard is out the doors to the west, and a
wide passage leads north into the dining room.

>n
Dining Room
This is the Hovse's dining room.  Several long wooden tables are arranged into
a couple of rows, and chairs are lined up on either side of each table.  A wide
passage leads south, to the lounge, and a pair of swinging doors to the east
leads to the kitchen.

The room is about half full of students, sitting around the tables eating
lunch.

You spot Aaron and Erin at one of the tables.  Erin takes you into the kitchen
and shows you where to buy a meal pass, and gives you a quick tour of the lunch
options.  The set-up hasn't changed much since you were a student, nor,
apparently, has the quality of the food.  You load up a tray, go back to the
dining room, and sit down with Aaron and Erin.

>s
(first standing up)
You spend a leisurely hour or so eating lunch and chatting with Aaron and Erin.
Eventually, the dining room starts to clear out, and Aaron mentions that he and
Erin need to get back to their stack.  You finish up the edible parts of your
lunch and drop off your tray.  Erin and Aaron head toward Alley Seven; you wish
them luck on their way out.

On the small table are a signal generator and an oscilloscope.

A huge mainframe computer fills the hall, leaving very little space to pass.
Several Mitachron technicians are standing near it, working the controls.

One of the technicians working on the computer is Xojo.

Belker is walking around slowly, supervising the technicians.

>plug generator into black box
The signal generator is already attached to the black box.

>turn it on
The signal generator is already on.

One of the technicians points something out to Belker, who nods and returns to
his pacing.

>plug scope into box
You make some adjustments on the scope, and start probing the contacts.  The
patterns jump right out at you now: this is a simple serial data communication
circuit, but it's disguised well enough with weird voltages and wave patterns
that you didn't recognize it before.

Ideally, you'd go build a compatible interface, then plug in a terminal to see
what the message is.  But there's no time for that; you'll have to just try to
read the data right off the scope.  It's a good thing you memorized ASCII in
binary a long time ago.  It takes you a couple of minutes to get the hang of it
again, but the bit patterns finally start looking like letters and numbers:

   3...  9...  2...  )...  H...  O...  V...  A...

Eventually the sequence starts repeating; it's just repeating a short message
in a loop.  You watch it go by a few times until you're convinced it really is
repeating the same message each time:

   HOVARTH(17281392)

This is almost trivial!  "Hovarth" is one of those obscure math functions; the
solution to the stack must simply be to calculate the result and key in the
number.  All you need to do is to find a copy of the DRD math tables, and look
up this Hovarth number.

You put down the scope probe, and suddenly realize Belker is hovering behind
you.  "I take it you have discovered a hidden message," he says.  "Perhaps you
will be more efficient than my inferiors at formulating a response."  He
chuckles and goes back to watching the technicians.

This room is set up roughly like a private office.  A desk is positioned across
the center of the room, facing the door, and behind the desk are floor-to-
ceiling bookshelves, crammed with print-outs, binders, folders, and loose
papers.  Most of the space on the desk is occupied by several terminals and
workstations.  The door leads out to the east.

The bookshelves contain some papers.

A man is sitting behind the desk.

The man looks up as you enter.  "Hi," he says.

>talk to man
"Hi," you say, "I'm Doug."

He gives you a little nod.  "I'm Dave," he says.  "What can I do you for?"

>ask him about 192.168.11.38
"Could you look up an IP address for me?" you ask.

He frowns and scrutinizes your face for a few moments.  "Why would you want me
to do that?" he asks suspiciously.

(You could tell him about the SPY-9 camera, or say you're a private detective.)

>tell him about spy-9
You hesitate to say too much, because you can't be sure who was involved with
planting the camera.  "I'm trying to track down some monitoring equipment," you
say.  "We're not sure exactly where it's plugged in."

He seems to accept that.  "Okay, let me see what I can find."  He types on his
terminal, looks at the screen, types some more.  "Hmm."  He rolls his chair
over to the wall and scans his fingers over some binders, then pulls one out
and flips through it.  He puts it back and returns to the terminal.  "That's in
a block we gave to NIC," he says.  "The contractors we have doing some new
wiring."  He taps away at the terminal.  "They're supposed to tell us how
they're using these, but they're not always all that prompt."  He goes back to
the shelf and pulls out another binder, and scans through it.  "Here we are.
Sorry, bad news.  All they gave us is a job number, which won't do either of us
a fat lot of good."  He puts the binder back.

>ask him about job number
"Just out of curiosity, what was that job number?"

He shrugs and pulls out the binder again, and finds the right page.  "Here it
is.  1082-9686.  Won't do you much good, though--they have their own private
system for those."

Quad
This open lawn area is known as the Quad, for its rectangular shape.  Several
walkways meet here: the Olive Walk leads east and west, the Orange Walk leads
down a few steps to the south, and another walkway leads north.  To the
northwest is the campus bookstore.  The two main student house complexes lie a
short distance to the east: the North Houses on the north side of the Olive
Walk, and the older South Houses on the south side.

Alongside the Olive Walk, a couple of workers are standing by an open
rectangular manhole, which they've cordoned off with yellow "Caution" tape
strung around some stakes in the ground.  Several big spools of wire are piled
up next to the manhole.

West Olive Walk
The olive walk runs east and west here through a broad lawn flanked by academic
buildings.  On the north side is the beige, rectilinear expanse of Thomas.
Firestone, to the southeast, and Guggenheim, to the southwest, are joined
together by a second-story bridge over the wide gap between them; a paved
walkway leads south under the bridge.

Lauritsen-Downs Courtyard
This is a small courtyard bounded by lab buildings: Guggenheim to the north,
Firestone to the east, and Lauritsen-Downs to the south and west.  A walkway
leads north under a second-story bridge connecting Firestone and Guggenheim.
The entrance to Lauritsen-Downs is to the south; the other buildings are just
blank walls here, except for a door marked "Emergency Exit" in the northwest
corner of Guggenheim.

A tall, rotund man is walking slowly along the outside of Lauritsen, looking
closely at the building.

>x rotund man
He's a tall, rotund, ruddy man with curly hair, wearing denim overalls with an
embroidered nametag reading "Ernst."  You surmise that he's an electrician,
from the tools hanging off his belt--voltmeters, crimpers, wire cutters.  He's
walking slowly near Lauritsen, looking closely at the building.

"Excuse me," you say, holding out the card.

He reads it over and says something in German, then hands the card back to you.

East Olive Walk
The Olive Walk is named for the olive trees lining both sides of the brick-
paved walkway and arching overhead.  The walkway runs east and west between the
two main undergraduate house complexes: the newer North Houses on the north
side, and the older South Houses on the south side.  The front entrances to the
houses face the walkway.  An antique cannon sits in front of Fleming to the
south.

A gardener is standing in the raised basket of a cherry picker, trimming
branches from one of the olive trees.

>give gardener the green card
"Here," you say, holding the card up for the gardener.

He lowers the basket enough to reach the card, and looks it over.  "They said
trim this tree!" he says.  He reads the card again, then looks resigned.  "Ja

muttering in German.

him with a pair of tree clippers.

Ernst abruptly stops running from the gardener and turns around, holding out a

You step on the pedal, and the cart accelerates to a full two miles per hour.
You steer the cart along the path.

West Olive Walk (standing in the basket of the cherry picker)
The olive walk runs east and west here through a broad lawn flanked by academic
buildings.  On the north side is the beige, rectilinear expanse of Thomas.
Firestone, to the southeast, and Guggenheim, to the southwest, are joined
together by a second-story bridge over the wide gap between them; a paved
walkway leads south under the bridge.

You steer the cherry picker to a spot off the path, right next to the wall of
Firestone, and park.

>raise basket
You push the lever all the way forward, and a whining electric motor slowly
raises the basket until the boom is fully extended.  You release the lever, and
it springs back to the center position.

The latticework grill facing Firestone is now within arm's reach.

>climb building
(first putting everything away)
You carefully climb up onto the edge of the basket and reach out for the
Firestone grill.  The pattern of the latticework offers surprisingly easy
handholds.  You feel you have a secure grip on the wall, so you take one foot
off the basket and search for a toehold.  No problem so far.  You take a deep
breath and commit yourself, taking your other foot off the basket, shifting
your full weight to the wall.

You don't immediately fall, so you try moving up the wall a few inches.  It's
actually pretty easy; almost like climbing a ladder.  You move up a few feet,
getting the hang of it.

Climbing Firestone
This point is about halfway up the side of Firestone.  The latticework grill
facing the building is relatively easy to climb; it extends above to the roof,
and below to about one story above ground level.

The cherry picker is parked next to the building, almost directly below.

>u
You work your way up to the top of the wall.  Once you're at the top, you roll
yourself over the edge and onto the roof.

Roof of Firestone
A knee-level lip runs around the perimeter of this flat, tar-coated roof,
providing a modicum of protection against walking off the edge.  Numerous
vents, pipes, and other fixtures protrude at random spots.

The roof narrows and continues west, over the bridge connecting Firestone and
Guggenheim.  The latticework grill facing the north side of the building comes
up to the roofline, so it should be possible to climb down that way.  At the
southeast corner, a ladder leads down the south wall.

>se
Roof of Sync Lab
The surface of the roof seems to be asphalt.  The roof is flat, but the surface
is uneven from numerous patches and repairs.  Near the west edge, a rectangular
fixture of unpainted sheet metal rises up a couple of feet.

The roof ends to the north at the back wall of Firestone, which rises up
another story from here.  A ladder is bolted to the wall, leading up the side
of the building.

>open door
Opening the door reveals a wrought-iron ladder leading down a shaft.

>d
(first standing on the rectangular fixture)
Your eyes slowly adjust to the dim interior as you climb down the ladder.
After about twenty rungs, you reach a landing.

Catwalk near Ladder
This is a narrow metal walkway clinging to the west wall of a cavernous
interior space.  Weak yellow light filters down from fixtures overhead, but
only darkness is visible below.

A wrought-iron ladder, bolted to the wall, leads up to a small opening
overhead.  A patch of sky is visible through the opening.  The catwalk
continues north along the wall, and ends to the south at a stairway leading
down.

>d
Sync Lab near Stairs
This corner of the Sync Lab floor is closed in by boxes and crates stacked high
all around, with just enough space left open to form a walkway.  The area along
the west wall is mostly clear, providing access to a metal stairway, which
leads up to the north.  A path is open to the northeast as well.

>ne
Open Area
This is a large clearing in the clutter of boxes and crates filling the Sync
Lab.  Yellow light trickles down from fixtures high overhead, faintly
illuminating the tightly-packed stacks of crates bounding the area to the east,
west, and south.  A narrow passage leads between stacks to the southwest, and
the way north is mostly open.  Another small opening between boxes leads to the
southeast.

The way west is blocked by an especially large metal crate.

>n
Under Catwalk
This is an open area among the crates.  The clearing extends to the south;
dense stacks of boxes and crates wall off the other directions, although a
passage has been left clear to the east, and a narrow opening might be passable
to the southwest.

Overhead, about one story up, the underside of a metal catwalk is just visible
in the dim light.  The catwalk runs east and west, but it's interrupted
directly overhead by a wide gap of about ten feet.

>sw
Under Stairs
This is a cramped, dark nook underneath a stairway, which slopes down until it
reaches the floor at the south end of the area.  Boxes and crates are stuffed
into the sloping space, leaving little space to move around.  A narrow opening
through the crates leads northeast.

A huge metal crate is blocking the way east.

>push crate
You lean against the huge crate and give it a good, solid push.  It slowly
starts rolling, and you step forward, digging in your heels, still pushing it.
A few feet in, you notice the other crates and boxes stacked alongside start
wobbling precariously.  You urgently push the wall of aluminum forward, and you
just manage to get out of the way as piles of boxes come tumbling in from all
directions to fill the gap.

You let the crate roll to a stop in the center of the area.

>push it north
You give the crate a strong push, and it starts rolling north.  You keep
pushing it, picking up speed, when suddenly it slams to a halt with a loud
metal-on-metal crash that echoes from overhead.  You look up, and you realize
that the crate has wedged itself between the two ends of the catwalk, filling
in the gap.

catwalk, apparently the continuation of this one, is barely visible about ten
feet further east.  Above the gap, high overhead, the underside of what looks
to be a bridge is visible.

Just this side of the gap is a control panel.

This small, low-ceilinged room is lit mostly by the glow of a bank of video
monitors arrayed along one wall.  In the center of the room, facing the
monitors, sits a wrap-around desk with an office chair; a computer is on the
desk.  Opposite the monitors is a set of shelves lined with rows of identical
black binders.  A gray door leads out to the south.

It's not actually a computer; it's really one of those awful MitaMail e-mail

The terminal is a one-piece unit with an amber text display and a keyboard.

This is the top of a crate, which is wedged between the ends of the catwalk to
the east and west.  The crate is easily large enough to stand on, providing a
bridge across the gap.  Overhead, another section of catwalk is visible,
suspended from above.

>w
Catwalk at Gap
The catwalk extends west, and abruptly ends to the east.  Another section of
catwalk, apparently the continuation of this one, is barely visible about ten
feet further east.  Above the gap, high overhead, the underside of what looks
to be a bridge is visible.

Just this side of the gap is a control panel.

A huge metal crate is wedged between the ends of the catwalk.  Its top is
roughly level with the catwalk, creating a bridge across the gap.

>w
Catwalk, at Corner
This is a corner in the raised metal walkway.  The catwalk continues south,
along the west wall of the building, and east into the murky twilight.

>s
Catwalk near Ladder
This is a narrow metal walkway clinging to the west wall of a cavernous
interior space.  Weak yellow light filters down from fixtures overhead, but
only darkness is visible below.

A wrought-iron ladder, bolted to the wall, leads up to a small opening
overhead.  A patch of sky is visible through the opening.  The catwalk
continues north along the wall, and ends to the south at a stairway leading
down.

>u
You make your way up the ladder, climbing out through the opening when you
reach it.

Roof of Sync Lab (standing on the rectangular fixture)
The surface of the roof seems to be asphalt.  The roof is flat, but the surface
is uneven from numerous patches and repairs.  Near the west edge, a rectangular
fixture of unpainted sheet metal rises up a couple of feet.

The roof ends to the north at the back wall of Firestone, which rises up
another story from here.  A ladder is bolted to the wall, leading up the side
of the building.

>u
(first getting off of the rectangular fixture)

Roof of Firestone
A knee-level lip runs around the perimeter of this flat, tar-coated roof,
providing a modicum of protection against walking off the edge.  Numerous
vents, pipes, and other fixtures protrude at random spots.

The roof narrows and continues west, over the bridge connecting Firestone and
Guggenheim.  The latticework grill facing the north side of the building comes
up to the roofline, so it should be possible to climb down that way.  At the
southeast corner, a ladder leads down the south wall.

>w
Roof of Guggenheim
The whole south side of the roof is dominated by the Guggenheim wind tunnel: a
long, low steel structure, resembling an extremely elongated storage shed.  The
roof continues east, narrowing over the bridge connecting Guggenheim to
Firestone.

>x structure
The structure runs the full east-west extent of Guggenheim, but it's low and
narrow.  A complex network of pipes and conduits runs along the walls of the
structure, turning and twisting around one another.  A group of pipes makes
right-angle turns around a small panel low on the wall.

>x panel
The panel looks to be a small door, about a meter square, near the bottom of
the wall.  It's probably an access door for mechanical work on the tunnel
apparatus.  It's closed.

>open it
Opening the panel reveals a passage that seems to lead inside the structure.

>s
You get down on all fours and crawl through the passage.

Wind Tunnel Lab
This is a long, low, narrow space, crammed with equipment.  It doesn't seem to
be the sort of wind tunnel with a gigantic fan at one end of a big, empty room.
Instead, the "tunnel" looks more like a cement mixer: a bright blue metal
cylinder about ten feet long and six feet in diameter, lying on its side.  The
cylinder is tapered to a smaller diameter at each end, where it's connected to
stacks of heavy industrial machinery that would look at home in an auto plant.

A wrought-iron spiral stairway leads down a narrow shaft.  A low door to the
north, almost hidden under pieces of equipment, leads outside.

>x hatch
It's a round metal hatch, about two feet in diameter.  It's currently closed.

>open it
Opening the metal cylinder reveals a squirrel action figure.

>get squirrel
Taken.

You get on your hands and knees and crawl out through the passage.

Roof of Guggenheim
The whole south side of the roof is dominated by the Guggenheim wind tunnel: a
long, low steel structure, resembling an extremely elongated storage shed.  A
small, low door leads into the structure.  The roof continues east, narrowing
over the bridge connecting Guggenheim to Firestone.

>e
Roof of Firestone
A knee-level lip runs around the perimeter of this flat, tar-coated roof,
providing a modicum of protection against walking off the edge.  Numerous
vents, pipes, and other fixtures protrude at random spots.

The roof narrows and continues west, over the bridge connecting Firestone and
Guggenheim.  The latticework grill facing the north side of the building comes
up to the roofline, so it should be possible to climb down that way.  At the
southeast corner, a ladder leads down the south wall.

>n
(first putting everything away)
You back up to the north edge of the roof and lie down on the lip, then lower
your legs over the edge.  You find a toehold and start working your way down
the wall.

Climbing Firestone
This point is about halfway up the side of Firestone.  The latticework grill
facing the building is relatively easy to climb; it extends above to the roof,
and below to about one story above ground level.

The cherry picker is parked next to the building, almost directly below.

>d
You carefully climb down the grill until you're level with the basket, then
ease yourself into the basket.

West Olive Walk (standing in the basket of the cherry picker)
The olive walk runs east and west here through a broad lawn flanked by academic
buildings.  On the north side is the beige, rectilinear expanse of Thomas.
Firestone, to the southeast, and Guggenheim, to the southwest, are joined
together by a second-story bridge over the wide gap between them; a paved
walkway leads south under the bridge.

>d
(out of the basket of the cherry picker)
(first lowering the basket of the cherry picker)
You pull the lever all the way back, and the basket slowly descends.  Once the
boom is fully retracted, the descent stops, and you let the lever spring back
to the center position.

Okay, you're no longer in the basket of the cherry picker.

>e
Quad
This open lawn area is known as the Quad, for its rectangular shape.  Several
walkways meet here: the Olive Walk leads east and west, the Orange Walk leads
down a few steps to the south, and another walkway leads north.  To the
northwest is the campus bookstore.  The two main student house complexes lie a
short distance to the east: the North Houses on the north side of the Olive
Walk, and the older South Houses on the south side.

Alongside the Olive Walk, a couple of workers are standing by an open
rectangular manhole, which they've cordoned off with yellow "Caution" tape
strung around some stakes in the ground.  Several big spools of wire are piled
up next to the manhole.

>s
Orange Walk
This north-south walkway is named for the orange trees planted alongside.  A
few steps ascend to the north.  To the south, the walkway ends at California
Boulevard, which forms the southern limit of the campus.  An unpaved path
through the orange trees leads west.  To the east, a passage leads into Dabney
Hovse.

>e
Breezeway
This wide passageway opens onto a courtyard to the east, and to the west leads
out of the house to the Orange Walk.  A dimly-lit hallway leads into the house
to the north; painted on the wall alongside the hallway is the legend "1-9".

>e
Courtyard
This large interior courtyard is dominated by what looks to be a papier-mƒch‚
scale-model mountain: a two-story edifice of cliffs and boulders, rising in the
center of the courtyard to a peak higher than the surrounding courtyard walls.
Piled randomly around the base are metal canisters marked with radiation
warnings, many split open and leaking green goo.

The courtyard itself follows the Mediterranean style of the south houses: red
brick floor, stucco walls, casement windows, columns supporting an arcaded
overhang to the east, terra cotta tiles on the gently-sloped roofs.  Under the
overhang, doors lead east into the lounge.  The alley 3 entrance is to the
southwest, and alley 5 is to the southeast.  A small alcove lies to the south.
To the west is a breezeway leading outside, and a long concrete stairway goes
up.

>sw
Alley Three Entry
This is the middle of Alley Three, which runs east and west from here.  The
exit to the courtyard is to the north, and next to it a stairway leads up.  The
door to room 13 is to the south.

>u
Alley Four
This is the middle of Alley Four, where the hallway widens into a good-sized
lounge area.  The two wings of the alley lead off to the east and west,
respectively, and to the north, a stairway leads down.  A large round table and
some chairs are set up here.

About a half dozen students are sitting or standing around the table, working
on a pile of papers spread out over the surface.

>ask about jay
(asking the students)
"Excuse me," you say, "but I'm looking for Jay Santoshnimoorthy."

Everyone looks at one of the students, who looks up at you.  "I'm Jay," he
says.

With the aloha shirt, his build, and his long hair, Jay looks like a surfer
dude.

>ask jay about calculator
You describe the calculator to Jay and ask him if he knows anything about it.

"Sounds pretty generic," he says.  "Maybe if I could take a look at it..."

>show calculator to jay
(first taking the pocket calculator from the tote bag)
"Have a look at this," you say, handing Jay the calculator.

He turns it over a couple of times, turns it on, taps on the keys for a bit.
The calculator starts beeping a little tune.  One of the other students groans
and playfully tries to grab the calculator from Jay, but Jay dodges out of the
way.

"Don't encourage him," the other guys says.  "He just can't help showing off
his nerdly trick."

Jay laughs.  "Sorry," he says.  He turns off the calculator and hands it back.

(You could ask him about programming hovarth numbers.)

>ask him about hovarth numbers
"Have you heard of Hovarth numbers?" you ask.

"Yes, most definitely," he says.  "We had a phys homework a few weeks ago that
was all about Hovarth numbers.  Entirely heinous stuff."

>ask him about programming hovarth numbers
"Could you program a Hovarth function on my calculator?" you ask.

Jay looks nonplussed.  "Um, dude, are you out of your mind?  I mean, I could,
but nobody has that kind of time.  We're talking heat death of the universe."

>give him 73:9a
(first taking Quantum Review Letters number 73:9a from the tote bag)
"You might find this interesting," you say, offering the journal to Jay.

He takes it and scans over the abstract.  "Hm," he says, then sits down and
starts reading through the article.

>z
Time passes...

>z

Jay gets up and hands you the journal.  "That's pretty bizarre stuff.  I wonder
if it would really work?" He ponders something for a few moments, then smiles.
"Hey, that would be perfect for Hovarth numbers!  Maybe I could program your
calculator to figure Hovarth-of-X, and we could try it out."

>z
Time passes...

>give him calculator
You offer Jay the calculator, but he doesn't take it.  "Tell you what," he
says.  "We need someone to rescue Turbo Power Squirrel.  We've figured out that
he's in the Guggenheim wind tunnel, but no one's got any time to go get him.
If you could go rescue him and bring him back here, I'll help you out with
programming your calculator."

>give him squirrel
(first taking the squirrel action figure from the tote bag)
You offer the squirrel action figure to Jay.  "Hey!  That's great!"  He takes
the squirrel and holds it up for everyone to see.  "Turbo Power Squirrel is
safe!"  Everyone cheers.  Jay puts the figure on the table.

(Your score has just increased by five points.)

>give him calculator
You hand Jay the calculator.  He starts tapping furiously at the keypad with
both thumbs, almost too fast to see.  "This is perfect," he says, still typing
away.  "The chipset in this model has an unstable flip-flop on the key
debouncer that we can use as a true random source."

He finally finishes, smiling broadly at his handiwork.  "There," he says,
handing the calculator back to you.  "It's the least I could do for the man who
rescued Turbo Power Squirrel."  He points to the "+" key.  "All you have to do
is enter the number for the Hovarth function, then press `plus' three times in
a row, really fast.  So type the number, then type plus-plus-plus.  Make sure
the quantum thingy is going when you do.  The result should come right up."

Jay goes back to the table.

Rock Garden
The walkway winds its way through a rock garden set within a terraced series of

to the east.  A distance off to the west, you can see the Millikan library
towering above.

>w
Millikan Pond
The nine-story obsidian tower of the Millikan Library is to the west, rising
above the wide rectangular pond that fills the large open area north of the
walkway.  A combination abstract sculpture and fountain in the center of the
pond shoots several streams of water into the air.

Bridge Lab is a short distance to the south, and the entrance to the library is
to the west.  A path leads east, down a hill.

>s
Bridge Lab Entryway
This entry hall reflects the different sense of proportion architects had in
the 1920s: it's a bit too narrow and a bit too tall to the modern eye.  At the
south end of the hall, stairs lead up and down, and a doorway at the north end
leads outside.  A display case is set into the east wall.

>d
Basement Hall
It's just the basement, but this hallway has an almost oppressively
subterranean feel, as though it were buried deep underground: the air is damp
and musty, the lighting dim, the slightly-arched ceiling so low that you can't
quite stand up straight.  The hall continues west, and ends to the east in a
stairway leading up, back to the land of the surface dwellers.

A door labeled 021 leads south, and another numbered 022 leads north.  The hall
continues to the west.

>n
Lab 022
Improvised equipment is packed into this small lab, which feels a bit like an
underground parking garage thanks to the low ceiling and concrete surfaces.
The room is dominated by a big steel lab bench roughly in the center of the
lab, and pieces of equipment are arrayed around the bench and along the walls.
A set of shelves on the back wall are laden with yet more equipment.

>put calculator on platform
(first taking the clear plastic dome from the glass platform)
Done.

>push green button
You push down on the giant button.  There's an immediate clunk from somewhere
in the room, then a deep humming sound that gradually rises in pitch.  The
humming keeps rising and getting louder until it sounds like a car horn.

The air over the glass platform in the center of the ring of magnets starts to
shimmer.

>type 17281392+++ on calculator
(first turning on the pocket calculator)
Your hand becomes slightly blurry as you reach into the shimmering air over the
platform.  This makes it hard to be sure you're finding the right keys, but you
try your best.  You pull your hand back as soon as you're done.

The calculator's display blurs, the digits turning into fuzzy blobs of light.
For that matter, the entire calculator seems oddly out of focus.

The humming of the equipment starts dropping in pitch like a turbine winding
down.  The calculator suddenly snaps into sharp focus, the display reading
"35506392.".  The noise of the equipment fades out and then stops entirely.

Assuming Jay's programming worked, that should be the number for the stack.
Now you just have to go enter it into the black box.  Fortunately, that should
be relatively easy: earlier, when you were looking at the black box with the
oscilloscope, you noticed that part of the circuit was a ten-level voltage
digitizer.  That must be the input device.  All you need is a way to produce
voltages in the right range, which you should be able to do with the signal
generator.

Alley One South
Some of the other houses give fanciful names to their alleys, but for some
reason the Darbs never bothered; they just refer to their alleys by number,
this one being Alley One.  Room 1 is to the east and room 2 to the west; the
hallway continues north, and a doorway leads south.

The walls are heavily adorned with graffiti, as they were when you were a

Alley One North
Alley One ends here in a stairway leading up.  Room 3 is to the east and room 4

Next to the door to room 4 is a small table, on which is a black metal box that
looks like it could once have been a microwave oven.  A sign (really just a
sheet of paper) is fastened to the door above the box.

On the small table are a signal generator and an oscilloscope.

A huge mainframe computer fills the hall, leaving very little space to pass.
Several Mitachron technicians are standing near it, working the controls.

One of the technicians working on the computer is Xojo.

Belker is walking around slowly, supervising the technicians.

Belker confers quietly with one of the technicians for a few moments.

>plug signal generator into box
You turn on the generator, then attach it to the connector pin you think is the
"clear" switch, to make sure the box's internal number memory is zeroed.  You
give it a few moments, then you attach the connector to the pins going to the
voltage digitizer, and you adjust the generator settings to the right voltage
range.  It should now be set up to enter digits, one at a time, using the
amplitude knob.

A couple of the technicians trade places on the Mitavac.

>turn it on
The signal generator is already on.

The Mitavac's throbbing seems to get a little quieter.

The black box emits a soft beep.  You'd assume that this means the box accepted
the current digit.

>turn dial to 3; turn it to 5; z
Okay, the amplitude knob is now set to 3.

The black box emits a soft beep.

Frosst Belker wanders over to watch what you're doing.

Okay, the amplitude knob is now set to 5.

"So, Mr. Mittling," Belker says, "you have deduced the method by which digits
are entered, I see."

The black box emits a soft beep.

Time passes...

Belker clucks his tongue.  "If I were you, Mr. Mittling, I would not be wasting
the scant time remaining trying digits at random."

The black box emits a soft beep.

>turn it to 0; turn it to 6; turn it to 3
Okay, the amplitude knob is now set to 0.

Belker shakes his head.  "Your determination is admirable," he says, "but
surely you realize the impossibility of solving Mr. Stamer's riddle by
exhaustive enumeration."

The black box emits a soft beep.

Okay, the amplitude knob is now set to 6.

"At this pace," Belker says, "you might find the number you are seeking in,
perhaps, thirty years."

The black box emits a soft beep.

Okay, the amplitude knob is now set to 3.

"You know," Belker says, "my engineers will have the correct number very soon.
Perhaps I could persuade them to allow you to use their equipment afterwards.
It would, of course, be too late for you to win, but at least you might have
the satisfaction of solving the riddle for yourself."

The black box emits a soft beep.

>turn it to 9
Okay, the amplitude knob is now set to 9.

Belker chuckles.  "Mr. Mittling, I begin to wonder if you even know what riddle
you are attempting to solve.  Given the lateness of the hour, I think it safe
to offer you a small hint: it has something to do with a mathematician named
Hovarth."

The black box emits a soft beep.

>turn it to 2
Okay, the amplitude knob is now set to 2.

Belker sighs.  "I cannot bear to watch these pointless exertions of yours for
much longer."

The black box emits a soft beep.  Then, after a few moments, it makes a loud
"Ding."

You realize that a crowd has formed in the hallway.  The technicians have all
abandoned the Mitavac and are standing watching you, and a couple dozen
students have arrived as well.  Everyone's silently watching you.

Belker looks confused.  "What does this dinging noise signify?" he asks
sharply.  As though to answer, the black box clicks, and the door to room 4
swings open.  The crowd cheers and applauds--even the Mitachron technicians are
smiling.  Belker just stands there with his jaw hanging open.

Some of the students start heading into room 4 to claim their share of the
bribe.  Belker makes his way over to you through the crowd.  He's regained his
composure now; he smiles faintly.  "Congratulations," he says.  "I am suitably
impressed with your resourcefulness.  I should like my technicians to study
your methods someday."  He seems about to say something else, but his cell
phone rings; he takes it out of his pocket and answers.  He moves away through
the crowd.

Room 4
The room has the cluttered yet spartan look of a student room.  It's a single,
so it's small; not quite so small that you can touch opposing walls at the same
time, but close enough.  Packed into the seventy or so square feet are a desk,
a chair, and a bed.  Bookshelves cover the wall above the desk.  A door leads
out to the alley.

Spread out on the desk is a nice selection of snack foods, arranged in a party
platter: chocolates, cookies, crackers, grapes, strawberries, cheese.

Some of the students and technicians follow you into the room to help
celebrate.  They head straight for the snacks and start digging in.

students as he makes his way through the crowd.  He finally comes to you and
stops.

"Hi," he says.  "I'm Brian Stamer.  I'm guessing you're the one who solved my
stack?"

(You could say yes, introduce yourself, or tell him about Project Galvani-2, or
the SPY-9 camera.)

>hello
"Yes," you say.  "I'm Doug Mittling, from Omegatron."  You shake hands.

"So," Brian says, "what did you think of the stack?"

(You could tell him about the stack, the black box, the calculator, Project
Galvani-2, or the SPY-9 camera.)

>tell him about stack
"Your stack was definitely a learning experience," you say.  "Your experiment
is quite something."

"You said you work for Omegatron?"  Brian asks.

>yes
"Yes, I work for Omegatron," you say.  This would be a good chance to tell him
about the company.

>tell him about company
"I do work for Omegatron," you say.  You start telling Brian about the company,
what your group does, what you do, what Brian might do as a new hire--your
standard spiel for candidates.  Mid-way through, it strikes you that your heart
really isn't in it; but you press on anyway.  "So," you conclude, "there are
some great opportunities, and we'd love to have you on board."

Stamer listens and nods.  "Sounds okay," he says, not sounding very
enthusiastic.

"Excuse me," a voice says from alongside you.  You and Brian turn to see Belker
standing there.  "My name is Frosst Belker," he says to Brian.  "I am with the
Mitachron Company.  You must be Brian Stamer--a pleasure at last to meet you."
He opens a bag he's carrying, and starts taking things out and handing them to
Brian: first a t-shirt, then a brochure, then a gigantic novelty baseball cap.
"Please accept these tokens of our esteem."  He holds up the baseball cap.
"This article, perhaps it is the wrong size for you.  Please, allow me to
assess the situation, if you would be so kind..."

Belker tries to put the cap on Brian's head, but Brian deftly ducks, takes the
cap from Belker, and sets it on the desk along with the other things.  "That's
okay," he says.  "I'll try it on later."

>z
Time passes...

Belker flashes you a thin smile.  "Before you expend too much energy on the
particulars of employment negotiations, Mr. Mittling, I bring news that will be
of considerable interest to you.  Moments ago I have spoken with my company's
headquarters, and I am pleased to say that Mitachron initiated a hostile
takeover of Omegatron early today."  He turns to Brian.  "So, you see, while
Mr. Mittling unarguably prevailed in the stack competition, he was technically
already an employee of Mitachron while doing so.  The victory is therefore
Mitachron's."  Belker turns back to you, smirking.  "Once again, Mr. Mittling,
we see that however diligent your efforts, in the end it is I who prevails.
And do not fret, Mr. Stamer; you can be assured that Mitachron's employment
terms will be most agreeable."

>z
Time passes...

"I'll think about your offer," Brian says to Belker.  He turns to you.
"Actually, there's something else I wanted to talk to you about.  A few friends
and I have been putting together a start-up company, based on the technology in
my lab.  The thing is, we need some people with industry experience, to keep
the investors happy.  We don't want just anyone, though."  He shoots a sideways
glance at Belker.  "That's the real reason I put together this stack--I figured
anyone who could solve it must be pretty good with technology.  The point is,
I'd like to hire you as our VP of engineering.  Interested?"

>yes
You almost say no just out of habit, out of fear of the unknown.  But thinking
back on your day, on all of the new and interesting challenges, on all of the
cool technology that Stamer's been working on, you realize how complacent
you've become at Omegatron, and how little reason you have to stay.  And with
this Mitachron takeover, you really want to get out of there.

"I'd love to," you say, surprising yourself a little.

"Great," Brian says.  You shake hands on the deal.

"No!"  Belker yells.  "This is not possible.  Mr. Stamer, you gave assurances
that you would accept a job at the winner's company.  Mr. Mittling won, and
Mitachron is his company, therefore you must accept a job at Mitachron."

(You could tell Belker you quit, offer Brian a job, or tell him about Project
Galvani-2, or the SPY-9 camera.)

>offer job
"I don't think you understand," you tell Belker.  "I don't work for Omegatron
or Mitachron any longer.  I work for Brian's company now."  You turn to Stamer.
"I know Mitachron will make you a good offer, but you did say you'd come work
for the winner's company.  So, what'll it be?  Will you come work for my new
company?"

"Why, yes," Brian says.  "I'd be thrilled to.  Sorry, Mr. Belker, but a deal's
a deal, and he did win the stack."

Frosst stands there looking like steam is about to come shooting out his ears.
He starts flailing his arms wildly.  "No!  No, no, no!  This is intolerable!"
A couple of Mitachron technicians come running over and try to calm him down,
but this just makes him more furious.  "You think you are so clever, both of
you."  More technicians have come over now, and they've started dragging him
away through the crowd.  "You have not heard the last of Frosst Belker, I
assure you.  You will see..."  His voice trails off as the technicians drag him
away.

Over the next few weeks, Brian's start-up comes together amazingly quickly.  By
the time the school year ends, you've already hired enough people to fill up
the new office space, including Xojo, who turns out to have some great
experience with semiconductor fab operations.  You know you have a lot of work
ahead of you, and a lot to learn, but you can already tell it's going to be a
great ride.
