<b>Getting Started in TADS 3</b>
</a>
<br>by Eric Eve

<p>This tutorial introduction is a great starting point for anyone new
to TADS 3 and new to programming.  The book opens with the basics of
getting TADS working on your system and setting up your first simple
game, so even if you've never done any programming before, this will
help you get going quickly.  The tutorial then leads you step by step
through the design of a full-scale example game, showing how to use
TADS to implement the effects needed in the game.  By the time you're
done, you'll know your way around the system and you'll be able to
write your own games.

<p><i>This book is accompanied by a sample game, </i>The Further Adventures
of Heidi<i>.  The game's source files can be found here:</i><tt>

<b>Learning TADS 3</b>
</a>
<br>by Eric Eve

<p>Part tutorial and part reference, <i>Learning TADS 3</i> is a
perfect place to start for confident beginners, and for people with a
little more programming experience.  This book is designed for
learning TADS on your terms - it's organized by functional area, so
once you've mastered the basics, you can skip around to focus on the
areas you're most interested in.  As you develop your game, you can
return to the book as a reference, to review the details of particular
TADS features.

<p><i>This book refers to a collection of sample games, which are
   available as a separate download - <a class=visible

<b>Introduction to HTML TADS</b>
</a>
<br>by Michael Roberts
 
<p>TADS 3 uses a variant of HTML as its formatting language.  These
notes explain how HTML fits into TADS, and how you can use HTML
formatting codes for text effects, graphics, and sound, and how the
TADS variant differs from standard HTML.  (These are essentially just
the original notes for HTML TADS 2, so they're a little rough, but
they are updated with relevant changes for TADS 3.  Note that this
isn't an HTML tutorial - but the HTML in TADS is pretty close to
standard HTML, so you can learn it from any of the many tutorials on
the Web for ordinary HTML.)
