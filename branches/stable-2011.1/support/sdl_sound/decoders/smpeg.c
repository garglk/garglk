/*
 * MPEG-1 Layer 3, or simply, "MP3", decoder for SDL_sound.
 *
 * This driver handles all those highly compressed songs you stole through
 *  Napster.  :)  It depends on the SMPEG library for decoding, which can
 *  be grabbed from: http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3
 *
 * This should also be able to extract the audio stream from an MPEG movie.
 *
 * There is an alternative MP3 decoder available, called "mpglib", which
 *  doesn't depend on external libraries (the decoder itself is part of
 *  SDL_sound), and may be more efficient, but less flexible than SMPEG. YMMV.
 *
 * Please see the file COPYING in the source's root directory.
