Building is pretty easy. Please read README, too, as it duplicates and
expands upon much of this information.


ALL PLATFORMS:

Please understand your rights and mine: read the text file COPYING in the root
of the source tree. If you can't abide by it, delete this source tree now.

The best documentation for the SDL_sound API is SDL_sound.h. It is VERY
heavily commented, and makes an excellent, in-depth reference to all the
functions. The official API reference is generated from this file with
a program called "Doxygen" (http://www.doxygen.org/)


Borland C++ Builder for Linux (Kylix 3):
 Unzip the "borland.zip" file in the root of the source tree and use the
 project files in the newly-created Borland/k3 directory. Makefiles for the
 command line compiler are in Borland/freebcc ...


Unix:
 (If you pulled the source from CVS), run ./bootstrap

 run ./configure --help, and see if there's any options you need. Rerun
 configure with those options. If this is confusing to you, just run
 ./configure with no options: the defaults are generally decent, and
 configure is usually smart enough to figure out what's best..

 If configuration succeeded, run "make".

 Run "make install" as root to install the library for use on your system.

 This should work for most Unix-style systems, including Linux, *BSD, BeOS, and
 MacOS X. Reports of success and failure are welcome.


MacOS 9 users:
 Included with the source is CWProject.sit, which contains project files for
 CodeWarrior 5.0 and later.


MacOS X command line tools:
 You can use the "UNIX" instructions above if you like the command line tools.


MacOS X Project Builder:
 If you prefer to use Project Builder, use the project files included with
 this source: PBProjects.tar.gz...unpack it in the root of the SDL_sound
 folder. This archive contains several external libraries you would have 
 to download/install manually if you used the command line tools (these
 libraries are for extra decoders, and are NOT required for SDL_sound to
 function...however, without them, the number of sound formats you can
 decode is reduced.)


BeOS:
 You can use the "UNIX" instructions above, too.


Win32 Visual C:
 For Visual C, use:
   http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/sdl_sound_visualc_srcs.zip
 ...and unzip it somewhere. This zipfile has a complete copy of the
 SDL_sound sources, Visual C project files, and several external libraries,
 too. This zip is everything you should need, and you can scrap this copy of
 the source.


Win32 Cygwin:
 Cygwin users can try their luck with the Unix build instructions in this
 tarball instead.


Win32 Borland C++ Builder 6:
 Unzip the "borland.zip" file in the root of the source tree and use the
 project files in the newly-created Borland/bcb6 directory. Makefiles for the
 command line compiler are in Borland/freebcc ... these are unmaintained, and
 you will need to go find the external libraries you want to use (those that
 wish to maintain these project files should contact me).


If building is successful, there will be a shared library and a binary
 called "playsound".


Windows CE (Microsoft PocketPC):
 You'll need Microsoft's PocketPC development environment, and this zipfile:
   http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/SDL_soundCE.zip

 Unzip that into the root of this source tree. The new "wce" directory has
  project files, and the source to some of the external decoders is included.
  Note that not all of the decoders are supported on PocketPC (but please, do
  send us patches if you get them working!)


OTHER PLATFORMS:

Send me patches, and instructions, and I'll list them here. Consider 
joining the SDL_sound mailing list. Details are at:
