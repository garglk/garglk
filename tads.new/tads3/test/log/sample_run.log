Welcome to the TADS 3 Library Sample Game!

Living Room
It's a nice, big room.  A potted plant is the only attempt at decoration.
Passages lead north, east, and west.  To the south, the front door of the house
leads outside.

An old television, a huge, boxy, massive-looking thing, sits on the floor.

You see a PO Box, a small red ball, a red book, an iron key, a clear jar, a
green jar (which contains two copper coins), a blue test booklet, a brass key,
a brown box, a tricycle, a rusty key, a green ball, an 8-ball, a large red
ball, eight coins (five gold and three silver), and a phone book here.

Bill and Bob are standing here.

Platform Room
This room is obviously highly contrived.  Filling one end of the room is a
platform, almost like a theater stage, raised a couple of feet above the floor.
At opposite ends of the platform are two smaller platforms, one red and one
blue; atop each smaller platform is a chair of the same color as its platform.
In the center of the main platform is a raised dais, upon which are a wooden
stool and a leather armchair.

The only exit is east.

On the main platform is a large white box, about waist high and quite roomy.

You can hear a high-pitched beeping noise.

Bill enters from the east.

>sit in box
(first standing on the main platform)
You can't do that because the white box is closed.

Bill stands on the main platform.

>open box

A small trap door is set into the floor of the box.

Dining Room
This medium-sized room[1] has a dining table and a couple of chairs, one
upholstered in dark fabric and other in light fabric.  A door (closed) leads
north.

A trophy is visible in a small alcove set into the top of one wall.

A bouquet of flowers is arranged in a vase in the center of the table.

On the table are a red candle, a white candle, a stretchy bag, a cookie tin,
and an inflatable rubber raft.

The flowers have a pleasant fragrance.

Bill enters from the south.

you can read by typing FOOTNOTE followed by the number: FOOTNOTE 1, for
example.  Footnotes usually contain added background information that might be
interesting but isn't essential to the story.  If you'd prefer not to see
footnotes at all, you can control their appearance by typing FOOTNOTES.)

It's a large[2] oval table.  On the table are a red candle, a white candle, a
stretchy bag, a cookie tin, and an inflatable rubber raft.

A bouquet of flowers is arranged in a vase in the center of the table.

It's shaped like a big cup, and looks to be made of silver.

Back Yard
This small yard has a well-kept lawn.  The edges of the yard are defined by
thick, tall hedges.  An old garden shed occupies the northwest corner of the
yard.  A door into the house is to the south.

In the center of the yard, floating in mid-air, is a red sphere.

Bill enters through the back door of the house.

>x sphere
The red sphere floats unnervingly in mid-air, with no apparent mechanical means
of suspension.  It does not hover like a balloon, but seems absolutely still,
as though firmly attached to an invisible pole.

Bob enters through the back door of the house.

>get it
The sphere is strangely fixed in place; it resists your attempts to move it.
It does seem to be able to rotate freely on its vertical axis, though, so you
could probably turn it if you wanted to.

>open it
That is not something you can open.

>eat it
The red sphere does not appear to be edible.

>put it in the duffel
(first trying to take the red sphere)
The sphere is strangely fixed in place; it resists your attempts to move it.
It does seem to be able to rotate freely on its vertical axis, though, so you
could probably turn it if you wanted to.

>turn it
Although the sphere is immovably fixed in space, it rotates so freely that it
feels weightless.  You give it the lightest touch, and it starts spinning
wildly, so fast that it becomes a featureless, glowing blur.  After a few
moments, it abruptly comes to a stop, and you see that its color has changed to
blue.

>push it
The sphere is strangely fixed in place; it resists your attempts to move it.
It does seem to be able to rotate freely on its vertical axis, though, so you
could probably turn it if you wanted to.

Shed
There's barely room to stand up or turn around in this tiny storage space.  The
north wall has a few deep shelves, but otherwise the structure is featureless.
A door leads out to the southeast.

On the shelf are a flashlight, a box of rat poison, and a book of matches.

Bill enters through the door.

>eat rat poison
It's not very tasty, but it sure is deadly.

Someone has jabbed a dagger into the top of the desk, leaving the dagger

The lever is surprisingly heavy, but you manage to pull it all the way out.  At
the end of its travel, something under the floor clicks, and the bookcase

soon as you release the lever, it springs back to its original position.

A youngish man in a garish suit is standing in the yard near the front door.

The man in the bad suit walks up to you and extends his hand; by habit you
shake his hand.  "Hello, friend!  My name is Ron, and I represent the Acturial
Life Insurance Company."  He releases your hand after a vigorous shaking.  "You
know, a lot of people I talk to don't know just how important life insurance is
to proper financial planning.  Let me ask you this: do you have all the life
insurance coverage you and your family need?"

A couple of bicyclists pedal past on the street.

>yes
"I'm covered," you say.

Ron smiles and nods.  "You know, a lot of people think they're covered.  But
have you really read your insurance policy?  Most insurance policies have so
many exclusions and limitations that you just can't rely on them.  That's why
Acturial Life created a new kind of insurance policy.  Let me tell you about
it..."

you."
