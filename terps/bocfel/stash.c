// Restoring (as in @restore) is done in-place, meaning that data
// structures used by the interpreter are updated during the restore. If
// any error is encountered during restore, the system could thus be in
// a state of partial update, preventing things from working properly.
// To avoid this, any structures which are updated in-place are first
// backed up. On restore failure, these will be restored. Anything can
// register functions to back up, restore, and free any particular piece
// of state that needs to be protected. The restore code will ensure
// these are all called appropriately.
//
// Required functions:
//
// void backup(void)  - Stash away the current state for future restore
// bool restore(void) - Restore the stashed state, returning true if it
//                      could successfully be restored, false otherwise.
// void free(void)    - Free any resources that were allocated by
//                      backup(). This can be called at any time,
//                      including before any calls to backup(), and
//                      including multiple times in a row without any
//                      intervening call to backup().
