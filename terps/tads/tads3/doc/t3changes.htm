<h1>TADS 3 Change History</h1>

<p>This is a list of changes to the TADS 3 core system: the language,
the built-in classes and functions, the compiler and related build
tools, the debugger, and the interpreter virtual machine.  The change
history is organized by release, with the most recent release first.

<p>(This page only covers changes to the core TADS language and
Virtual Machine engine.  There are separate release notes for most
operating system install packages - HTML TADS, FrobTADS, CocoaTADS,
etc.  For changes to the Adv3 library, see
<a href="../lib/adv3/changes.htm">Recent Library Changes</a>.)

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.1.3 (May 16, 2013)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The compiler now allows nested embedded "&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;"
expressions in strings.  Nesting wasn't allowed in the past; the
compiler now allows nesting up to a depth limit (currently 10
levels deep).  For example, this is now valid:

<pre>
   local x = 1;
   "This is the main string. &lt;&lt;
      "This is a nested string: x=&lt;&lt;x&gt;&gt."
   &gt;&gt; Back to the main string.";
</pre>

<li>In the past, HTML &lt;PRE&gt; blocks were problematic if you
wanted to use &lt;PRE&gt; for precise indentation.  The complication
was that the output formatter in the VM pre-filtered the text sent to
the HTML parser to consolidate each run of whitespace into a single
space.  If you wanted to use spaces in a &lt;PRE&gt; block for
alignment purposes, you had to use quoted spaces (<tt>"\ "</tt> sequences)
to make sure that all of the spaces were sent through to the HTML parser.

<p>Now, the VM formatter layer watches for &lt;PRE&gt; tags.  Within a
&lt;PRE&gt; block, the VM formatter passes spaces and newlines through
to the HTML parser without any filtering.  This change addresses
<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000178">bug #0000178</a>.

<p>Note that there's another slight complication if you're writing
multi-line preformatted blocks with spacing for indentation.  The
compiler normally removes the spaces that follow a line break within
a string.  The new compiler behavior described below gives you more
precise control over this, as does the new
<tt>#pragma newline_spacing(preserve)</tt> described later.

<li>In the <tt>#pragma newline(collapse)</tt> and <tt>#pragma
newline(delete)</tt> modes (see below), you can now override the default
line break handling for a particular line in a string by writing an
explicit <tt>\n</tt> sequence at the very end of the line.  When a
line within a string ends in <tt>\n</tt>, followed by a line break and
the continuation of the string on the next line, the compiler
preserves the whitespace at the start of the next line exactly as
written.  For example, consider the following string definitions,
assuming that we're in the normal "collapse" mode for newline spacing:

<pre>
   f()
   {
     local a = 'a
          b';
     local x = 'x\n
          y';
   }
</pre>

<p>For the first string, the compiler converts the
line break after the letter "a" and all of the whitespace at the
start of the next line into a single space, so the string's actual
contents end up as though you had written <tt>local a = 'a&nbsp;b';</tt>,
with just one space between the two letters.  But in the second
string, we've written an explicit <tt>\n</tt> at the end of the line,
telling the compiler to put an explicit line break into the string
and to preserve the subsequent whitespace.  This string is equivalent
to writing <tt>local x = 'x\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y';</tt>,
with the five spaces at the start of the second line kept intact.

<li>The <tt>#pragma newline_spacing</tt> directive now has three modes:

<ul>
   <li><tt>collapse</tt> mode (equivalent to the old <tt>on</tt> mode)
   collapses each line break within a string and any subsequent run
   of whitespace (at the start of the next line) into a single space.

   <li><tt>delete</tt> mode (equivalent to the old <tt>off</tt> mode)
   removes each line break and any subsequent run of whitespace,
   mashing the text of the two lines together without any spacing.

   <li><tt>preserve</tt> mode (new in this version) preserves spacing
   exactly as written in the source code, with the line break replaced
   by a <tt>\n</tt> (newline) character, and subsequent whitespace
   at the start of the next line kept intact.
</ul>

<p>Existing code that uses the pragma will continue to work without
any changes, because the former "on" mode is equivalent to the new
"collapse" mode, and the former "off" mode is equivalent to "delete"
mode.  The compiler continues to accept the old names, although new
code should use the new names for better clarity.

<li>The Web UI library code had a bug that prevented dialogs (such
as the display preferences dialog) from displaying properly on
Internet Explorer 9 and later.  This has been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000194">bugdb.tads.org #0000194</a>)


<li>The compiler error message for a symbol token containing an
accented letter or other non-ASCII character has been improved.  In
the past, the compiler treated a non-ASCII character as though it were
a symbol delimiter; for example, this had the effect of splitting
<tt>na&iuml;ve</tt> into three tokens: <tt>na</tt>, <tt>&iuml;</tt>,
<tt>ve</tt>.  The compiler then reported an "invalid character" error
for the <tt>&iuml;</tt> character.  The compiler now assumes that any
non-ASCII character that's adjacent to a character that's valid in a
symbol (i.e., not separated by any spaces or punctuation marks) is
meant to be part of the symbol token, so rather than reporting the
invalid character in isolation, the compiler now reports the error in
terms of the entire token containing the non-ASCII character.  This
should make it easier to pinpoint the source location of this type of
error.  The compiler also displays the numeric Unicode value of the
non-ASCII character, in case the character can't be displayed in the
console character set (on many systems, the command line console uses
a limited character set, such as Latin 1, that can't display the full
range of Unicode characters that could occur in the source).

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000185">bugdb.tads.org #0000185</a>)


<li>The IANA time zone database included in the base TADS release has
been updated to version 2013c (2013-04-20).

<li>On Windows, the interpreter behaved unpredictably (sometimes
crashing) when certain Date or TimeZone operations were attempted and
the Windows date/time locale was set to a time zone that uses standard
time year round (i.e., the time zone doesn't currently make annual
transitions between standard time and daylight time).  This is now
fixed.  (There were actually two separate problems contributing to the
bug, one specific to Windows and one in the portable code; both are
fixed.)

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000171">bugdb.tads.org #0000171</a>)

<li>In HTTPRequest.sendReply(), automatic content detection of the
MIME type based on a file's contents didn't work properly for files
shorter than 512 bytes.  This has been fixed.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000187">bugdb.tads.org #0000187</a>)

<li>For Web UI mode, a bug in the HTTPServer class caused the whole
server to shut down if any individual HTTPServer was terminated,
either explicitly by calling its shutdown() method, or automatically
when the object was deleted by the garbage collector.  This prevented
any more messages from being delivered via getNetEvent(), even if
other server objects were still listening for connections.  This
didn't actually affect most games in practice, because most Web UI
games create one HTTPServer object that listens for connections
throughout the server lifetime, but it was still incorrect behavior.
This has been corrected.

<li>The compiler crashed when presented with a "try" statement with an
empty "finally" block.  This is now fixed.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000176">bugdb.tads.org #0000176</a>)

<li>Starting in version 3.1.0, TADS Workbench didn't run under
Windows 2000 or earlier versions of Windows, due to a dependency
on a newer Windows feature that didn't exist until Windows XP SP1.
The dependency has been removed and replaced with code that should
work on Win 2K as well as newer systems, so Workbench should once
again be able to run on Win 2K.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000186">bugdb.tads.org #0000186</a>)

<li>The macro preprocessor incorrectly expanded macros containing
string embeddings in certain complex cases.  In particular, if the
last macro argument was used within an embedded expression within a
string within the macro expansion, and another separate embedding
followed, any subsequent mentions of a macro argument were not
expanded correctly.  The minimal case was something like this:

<pre>
#define M(a, b) '&lt;&lt;b&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;' a
</pre>

<p>This has been corrected. 

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000180">bugdb.tads.org #0000180</a>)

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.1.2 (August 20, 2012)</h3>

<ul>

<li>New syntax allows defining an object within an expression.  This
type of object is known as an inline object, and is essentially the
object analog of an anonymous function.  Methods of inline objects
behave like anonymous functions in that they can access locals from
the enclosing scope.  Inline objects are useful for a lot of the same
coding patterns where anonymous functions are useful, but allow for
more flexible APIs, since an object is a more general way to express
context information.  The new syntax also has the side benefit of
letting you define new objects at run-time with the dynamic compiler:
if you compile and evaluate an expression containing an inline object
definition, the result will be an instance of the object defined in
the expression.

<p>For full details, see <a href="sysman/inlineobj.htm">inline objects</a>
in the System Manual.

<li>The new String method <a href="sysman/string.htm#match">match()</a>
complements the <a href="sysman/string.htm#find">find()</a> method by
checking for a match at a given position in the subject string rather
than searching for a match.

<li><a href="sysman/filename.htm#getFileInfo">FileName.getFileInfo()</a>
now returns additional information on the file.  The new fileAttrs property
of the FileInfo object provides information on file attributes used on
some operating systems: the "hidden" and "system" attributes, and whether
the program has read and/or write access to the file.

<li>The documentation for
<a
href="sysman/filename.htm#removeDirectory">FileName.removeDirectory()</a>
has been changed to specify that the method definitely fails if
<i>deleteContents</i> is nil and the directory to be removed isn't
already empty.  In the past, the documentation stated that the
behavior for a non-empty directory varied by platform.  In fact, there
was no variation in practice - all of the existing platforms already
failed if a directory was non-empty and <i>deleteContents</i> was nil
- so the warning about variable behavior was just hedging in case any
future ports didn't work this way.  However, the internal porting
interface that implements directory removal now specifies this exact
behavior, so there's no longer any need for the hedge.

<li>In the past, when <tt>#pragma once</tt> checked to see if the same
file had been included previously, it was sensitive to case
differences in the filenames as written in the #include directives.
The comparison now uses the local file system conventions; on Windows,
for example, the comparison ignores case differences.

<li>The IANA time zone database included in the release has been updated
to version 2012e (2012-08-03).

<li>In 3.1.1, the debugger crashed if a run-time error was thrown by
a non-Adv3 program.  This has been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000157">bugdb.tads.org #0000157</a>)
 
<li>The UTF-8 character output mapper produced incorrect output when
mapping a string that ended with a non-ASCII character.  This is
now fixed.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000159">bugdb.tads.org #0000159</a>)

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.1.1 (July 14, 2012)</h3>

<ul>

<li>New syntax lets you create constant regular expression values:
<tt>R"<i>pattern</i>"</tt> and <tt>R'<i>pattern</i>'</tt> are
equivalent, and define static, pre-compiled RexPattern objects.  The
compiler converts a string of the form <tt>R"..."</tt> or
<tt>R'...'</tt> into a static RexPattern object, which you can
then use in any context where a pattern is required.  For example:

<pre>  local str = 'test string';
  local title = str.findReplace(R'%&lt;%w', {x: x.toTitleCase()});
</pre>

<p>To define a regular expression literal, the R must be capitalized,
and there must be no spaces between the R and the open quote.  "R"
strings can't use embedded expressions (the &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; syntax).
The triple-quote syntax can be used with R strings, as in
<tt>R"""..."""</tt>.

<p>In the past, you could achieve a similar effect by defining a
static property and setting it to a <tt>new RexPattern()</tt>
expression.  You can still use that approach, of course, but the new
syntax is more compact and eliminates the need to define an extra
property just to cache the RexPattern object.  Using the new syntax
also generates slightly more efficient code, since it doesn't require
a property lookup to retrieve the RexPattern object.  (There might be
other reasons to use the property approach in specific cases, though;
for example, in a library or extension, defining the pattern via a
property provides a clean way for users of the module to override the
pattern if they need to replace it with a customized version.)

<li>The basic integer arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, and the
corresponding combination operators such as ++ and +=) now check for
overflow, and automatically promote the result to BigNumber when an
overflow occurs.  In the past, overflows were simply truncated to fit
the 32-bit integer type.  It was very difficult to detect such cases
or to do anything sensible with the results; you really had to just be
careful to avoid overflows, which isn't easy when working with
external or user-entered data.  The new treatment ensures that the
results of the arithmetic operators will always be arithmetically
correct, even when they exceed the capacity of the basic integer type.
This is more in keeping with the TADS philosophy of providing
a high-level environment where you don't have to worry about
hardware-level details such as how many bits can be stored in an
integer.

<p>This change should be transparent to existing programs, since (a)
BigNumbers can for the most part be used interchangeably with
integers, and (b) any program that encountered an integer overflow in
the past probably misbehaved when it did, since there was no good way
to detect or handle overflows.  The effect on most existing programs
should thus be to allow them to correctly handle a wider range of
inputs.  In some cases, the effect will be to flag a run-time error
for a case where a value really does have to fit in an integer, where
in the past the code would have failed somewhat more mysteriously due
to the truncated arithmetic result.  The new handling should be an
improvement even in error cases, since the source of the error will
be more immediately apparent than in the past.

<p>There's a slight impact on execution speed because of the extra
checks required for arithmetic operations, although typical TADS
programs aren't arithmetically intensive enough to notice any
difference.  What's more, the VM-level checking eliminates the need
for extra program code to do bounds checking, so this could end up
being a performance enhancement in situations where overflows are a
concern.

<li>The compiler now automatically promotes any integer constant value
that overflows the ordinary integer type to BigNumber.  This applies
to values that are explicitly stated (e.g., "x = 3000000000;") as well
as to constant expressions (e.g., "x = 1000000000 * 3;").  The
compiler shows a warning message each time it applies such a
promotion; BigNumber values aren't necessarily allowed in all contexts
where integers are normally used, such as for some built-in function
and method arguments, so the compiler wants you to be aware when it
substitutes a BigNumber for a value you stated as an integer.  You can
remove the warning on a case-by-case basis by explicitly stating the
value as a BigNumber constant in the first place, by including a
decimal point in the number (e.g., "x = 3000000000.;").

<p>Integers specified in hex or octal notation (e.g., 0x80000000 or
040000000000) aren't promoted if they can fit within a 32-bit
<i>unsigned</i> integer.  Hex and octal are frequently used to enter
numbers with specific bit patterns, so the compiler assumes that's
your intention with these formats.  A hex or octal number that's over
the 32-bit unsigned limit of 4294967295 will be promoted, though,
since there's no way to store such a large value in a 32-bit integer
regardless of its signedness.

<li>The compiler now pre-calculates the results of arithmetic
expressions involving BigNumber constant values.  (This is known
as "constant folding".)  If an expression contains only constant
numeric values, with any combination of integers and BigNumber values,
the compiler will pre-calculate the results for the ordinary
arithmetic operators (+ - * / %) and the comparison operators (== !=
&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=).  In the past, the compiler deferred
calculations involving BigNumber values until run-time; constant
folding improves the execution speed of affected expressions for
obvious reasons.

<li>You can now use <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#sprintf">sprintf</a>
format codes directly within embedded expressions.  To do this, start
the expression with a "%" code immediately after the angle brackets,
with no intervening spaces.  For example, <tt>"x in octal is
&lt;&lt;%o x&gt;&gt;"</tt> will display <i>x</i>'s contents in octal
(base 8).  The compiler simply converts this sort of expression into a
sprintf() call with the given format code, so you can use the entire
range of format code syntax that sprintf() accepts.

<li>The new <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#sprintf">sprintf</a> format
codes %r and %R generate Roman numerals for integer values, in lower-
and upper-case.

<li>The String methods <a href="sysman/string.htm#find">find()</a> and
<a href="sysman/string.htm#findReplace">findReplace()</a> now accept a
RexPattern object as the search target.  An ordinary string can also
still be used, of course.  This essentially makes String.find() and
String.findReplace() replicate the functionality of
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rexSearch">rexSearch()</a> and
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rexReplace">rexReplace()</a>,
respectively; the main benefit is that the syntax for the String
methods is a little cleaner and more intuitive, since the subject
string is moved out of the parameter list.

<p>This is especially convenient with the new <tt>R'...'</tt> syntax
for creating static RexPattern objects.  For example,
<tt>str.find(R'%w+')</tt> finds the first word in a string.

<li>The String method
<a href="sysman/string.htm#findReplace">findReplace()</a> and the
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rexReplace">rexReplace()</a> function each
now take an optional additional argument, <i>limit</i>, specifying the
maximum number of replacements to perform.  If the <i>limit</i>
argument is omitted, the ReplaceOnce and ReplaceAll flags determine
the limit; if <i>limit</i> is included in the arguments, the
ReplaceOnce and ReplaceAll flags are ignored, and the <i>limit</i>
value takes precedence.  <i>limit</i> can be nil to specify that all
occurrences are to be replaced, or an integer to set a limit count.
Zero means that no replacements are performed, in which case
the original subject string is returned unchanged.

<li>The new String function
<a href="sysman/string.htm#findAll">findAll()</a> searches a string
for all occurrences of a given substring or regular expression, and
returns a list of the matches.

<li>Two new functions implement reverse searches in strings:
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rexSearchLast">rexSearchLast()</a> and
<a href="sysman/string.htm#findLast">String.findLast()</a> These
functions search a string from right to left, allowing you to find the
last (rightmost) match for a substring or regular expression pattern.

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rexGroup">rexGroup()</a> function
can now be used to get information on the entire match, by passing 0
for the group number.  rexGroup(0) returns the same format as the
other groups, but contains the text and location of the entire match
rather than of a parenthesized group within the match.

<li>TADS now has more complete support for Unicode case conversions.
Unicode defines two levels of case conversions; the older, simpler
level provides one-to-one character mappings between upper- and
lower-case letters, while the newer level allows for characters that
expand into multiple replacement characters when converting case.  The
canonical example is the German sharp S character, &#223;, which
changes to "SS" when capitalized - there's no such thing as a capital
sharp S in standard German typography.  For proper case conversion of
a string containing an &#223;, then, each &#223; character expands to
the two-character sequence "SS".  There are similar examples in other
languages, some involving other ligatures and some involving accented
characters that don't have upper-case equivalents.

<p>In past versions of TADS, only the one-to-one conversions were
supported.  Characters such as &#223; that required more complex
handling were generally left unchanged in case conversions.  TADS now
supports the full one-to-N mappings.  This won't affect most text,
since most characters have simple single-character replacements when
converting in upper or lower case.

<p>TADS also now supports Unicode "case folding", which is a separate
mapping for case-insensitive string comparisons.  In the past, TADS
generally approached case-insensitive comparisons by converting each
character to be compared to a common case (upper or lower), according
to which character was the "reference" character in the comparison.
Now, TADS uses the Unicode case folding tables instead, and converts
each character to its "folded" form for comparison.  The folded form
of each character is defined individually in the Unicode character
database tables, but in nearly all cases it's the same as converting
the character to upper case and then back to lower case.

<p>The new case conversion and case-folding support affects several areas:

<ul>

   <li><a href="sysman/regex.htm">Regular expressions</a>: when the
   &lt;nocase&gt; flag is specified, the matcher uses case folding to
   match each contiguous string of literals.  (In past versions,
   characters were compared by converting to the pattern character's
   case using the one-to-one conversions only.)

   <li>The String methods
   <a href="sysman/string.htm#toUpper">toUpper()</a> and
   <a href="sysman/string.htm#toLower">toLower()</a> use the new
   case conversion tables.  In the past, these used the older
   one-to-one case conversion tables.

   <li>The new String methods
   <a href="sysman/string.htm#toTitleCase">toTitleCase()</a> and
   <a href="sysman/string.htm#toFoldedCase">toFoldedCase()</a>
   use the new tables.

   <li>The new String method
   <a href="sysman/string.htm#compareIgnoreCase">compareIgnoreCase()</a>
   uses the full case folding tables to perform a case-insensitive
   comparison.

   <li>The <a href="sysman/strcomp.htm">StringComparator</a> class
   now uses full case folding when the comparator isn't case-sensitive.
   In the past, caseless comparisons were done by converting each
   input character to match the case of the corresponding dictionary
   character, using the one-to-one conversions only.

</ul>

<p>The new support only includes the unconditional case mappings.  The
Unicode tables define a number of case mappings that are conditional,
some on the language in use and some on string context.  TADS doesn't
currently support any of the conditional mappings.

<li>The new String method
<a href="sysman/string.htm#toTitleCase">toTitleCase()</a> converts
each character in the string to "title case".  This is the same as
upper case for most characters, but varies for some characters.  For
example, a character representing a ligature (e.g., the 'ffi' ligature
character, U+FB03) is converted to the corresponding series of
separate letters with only the first letter capitalized (so U+FB03
becomes the three separate letters F, f, i).

<li>The new String method
<a href="sysman/string.htm#toFoldedCase">toFoldedCase()</a> converts
each character in the string to its case-folded equivalent, as defined
in the Unicode standard.  The point of case folding is to erase case
differences between strings, to allow for case-insensitive
comparisons.  For most strings, the case-folded version is the same as
the lower-case version, although not always; characters that don't
have exact equivalents in the opposite case (e.g., the German sharp S,
&#223;) are generally handled as though they were first mapped to upper
case and then back to lower, so the result will sometimes expand one
character to two or more characters in the folded version (e.g., &#223;
turns into ss, so that 'WEISS' will match 'wei&#223;' in a case-insensitive
comparison).

<li>The new String method
<a href="sysman/string.htm#compareTo">compareTo()</a> compares the
target string to another string, returning a negative number if the
target string sorts before the second string, 0 if they're identical,
or a positive number i the target string sorts after the other string.
C/C++ programmers will recognize this as the standard strcmp()
behavior.  You can get the same information using comparison
operators, but compareTo() is more efficient for things like sorting
callbacks because it determines the relative order in one operation.
For example:

<p>
<pre>
   lst = lst.sort(SortAsc, {a, b: a &lt; b ? -1 : a &gt; b ? 1 : 0});
   lst = lst.sort(SortAsc, {a, b: a.compareTo(b)});
</pre>

<p>The two callbacks have the same effect, but the second is a little
more efficient, since it always does just one string comparison per
callback invocation.

<li>The new String method
<a href="sysman/string.htm#compareIgnoreCase">compareIgnoreCase()</a>
compares the target string to another string, using the case-folded
version of each string.  It returns the same type of result as
compareTo() - negative if the target string sorts before the other
string, zero if they're equal, and positive if the target sorts after
the other string, in all cases ignoring case differences.  This is
equivalent to calling compareTo() using the results of calling
toFoldedCase() on each string, but compareIgnoreCase() is more
efficient since it never constructs the full case-folded versions of
the two strings (it does the case folding character by character as it
compares the strings).

<li>The new function <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#concat">concat()</a>
returns a string with the concatenation of the argument values.  This
is essentially the same as using the "+" operator to concatenate a
series of strings, but it's more efficient when combining three or
more values, since the "+" operator is applied successively in
pairs and so has to build and copy an intermediate result string at
each step.

<li>The new function <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#abs">abs()</a>
returns the absolute value of an integer or BigNumber value.

<li>The new function <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#sgn">sgn()</a> 
returns the SGN (sign) of an integer or BigNumber value.  The SGN is 1
for a positive argument, 0 for zero, and -1 for a negative argument.

<li>The new t3make option -FC automatically creates the project's
output directories.  If this option is specified, the compiler creates
the directories specified in the -Fy, -Fs, and -o options, if they
don't already exist.  This makes it simpler to move a project to a new
directory or onto a new machine, since -FC makes it unnecessary to
create the output directories manually.

<li>HTTPRequest now recognizes GIF image files when sending a reply
body.  When the caller lets HTTPRequest auto-detect the MIME type in
sendReply() and related methods, the class will now use "image/gif"
when it detects a GIF file.  As with other binary file types, the
class recognizes GIF files by looking for the format's standard
signature near the start of the reply body data.  

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000139">bugdb.tads.org #0000139</a>)

<li>The new <a href="sysman/httpreq.htm">HTTPRequest</a> method
<a href="sysman/httpreq.htm#sendReplyAsync">sendReplyAsync()</a> lets
you send the reply to an HTTP request asynchronously, in a background
thread, so that the main program thread can continue to service other
requests while the reply is sent.  This is useful when the reply
contains a large content body, such as a large image or audio file.
Most browsers use background threads on the client side to download
large media objects, so that the UI remains responsive to user input
while the objects are downloaded; with the TADS Web UI, this means
that the browser can generate new XML requests while image or audio
downloads are still in progress.  The HTTPRequest sendReply() method
is synchronous, meaning that it doesn't return until the entire data
transfer has been completed.  This means that the program can't
service any new XML requests that the browser sends during the
download until after the download has completed and sendReply()
returns, which makes the UI unresponsive for the duration of the
download.  sendReplyAsync() addresses this by letting you initiate a
reply and then immediately return to servicing other requests, without
waiting for the reply data transfer to finish.

<p>The Web UI library uses the new method to send replies to requests
for resource files, since these files are often images, sounds, and
other media objects that can be large enough to take noticeable time
to transfer across a network.  Resource files are the mechanism that
most games use to handle their HTML media objects, so most game
authors shouldn't have to use sendReplyAsync() directly.

<li>The new class <a href="sysman/filename.htm">FileName</a> provides
a portable way to manipulate file names and directory paths, and
methods to operate on the corresponding file system objects named.
Each operating system has its own file path syntax, so it's always
been difficult to use ordinary strings to construct and parse
filenames that involve directory paths.  It's too easy to make
assumptions that tie the program to a single operating system; the
alternative has been to write a bunch of special-case code to handle
the syntax for each OS that you want to support.  The FileName class
helps by providing methods for common filename construction and
parsing operations, which are implemented appropriately for each
operating system where TADS runs.  TADS has always had many of these
portability functions internally for its own use, mainly for the
compiler and other tools; the FileName class makes them available to
TADS programs.  These new features will probably be of little direct
interest to game authors, but could be useful to library and tool
developers.

<p>In addition to building and parsing filenames, FileName
provides access to a much more complete set of file system functions
than was previously available.  The new class lets you create and
delete directories, list directory contents, retrieve file system
metadata (file sizes, types, modification dates), and move and
rename files.  As with the previously existing file access functions,
the new functions are subject to the file safety restrictions to
reduce the risk of malicious use and give the user control over
the scope of a program's file system access.

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsio.htm#inputFile">inputFile()</a> function
now returns a <a href="sysman/filename.htm">FileName</a> object to
represent the file chosen by the user, rather than a string.  Existing
code shouldn't be affected unless it's unusually dependent upon the
result being a string, since the FileName object can be passed to any
of the functions that open files (including the File.openXxx methods,
saveGame(), etc) in place of a string, and is automatically
converted to a string containing the file name in most contexts
where a string is required.

<p>A FileName returned by inputFile() has an internal attribute that
marks it as a user selection, which grants special permission to use
the file even if it wouldn't normally be accessible under the file
safety settings.  A manual selection via an inputFile() dialog
overrides the safety settings because of the user's direct
involvement; the user directly expresses an intention to use the file
in the manner proposed by the dialog, which is an implicit grant of
permission.

<li>Several of the system-level functions that access files are now
subject to file safety restrictions:
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#saveGame">saveGame()</a>,
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#restoreGame">restoreGame()</a>,
<a href="sysman/tadsio.htm#setLogFile">setLogFile()</a>,
<a href="sysman/tadsio.htm#setLogFile">setScriptFile()</a>, and
<a href="sysman/tadsio.htm#logConsoleCreate">logConsoleCreate()</a>
now enforce the appropriate read or write permissions according to the
file safety settings.

<p>In the past, these functions didn't enforce file safety settings,
mostly for practical reasons: these functions are all used by the Adv3
library to operate on files that are normally selected by the user, so
it would have been confusing to deny access in cases where the user
happened to choose a file outside the sandbox.  This was balanced
against the lower inherent risk with these functions, as compared to
the general-purpose File methods.  The game program can't use these
functions for arbitrary read/write operations; the actual data content
they read/write is largely under the control of the system, so there's
probably no way to use them to do something like planting a virus or
stealing private data.  However, since some of them create new files,
they could still be used for certain types of mischief, such as
overwriting system files or destroying user data.

<p>The thing that's changed - that allows us to bring these functions
into the file safety mechanism - is the new ability of
<a href="sysman/tadsio.htm#inputFile">inputFile()</a> to mark its
filename result as coming from a manual user selection, and the
corresponding file safety enhancement that grants access permissions
to such manually selected files.  This ensures that user file
selections for Save, Restore, etc. will still work properly, even when
they're outside the sandbox.

<li>The new <a href="sysman/date.htm">Date</a> built-in class provides
extensive functionality for parsing, formatting, and doing arithmetic
with calendar dates and times; it works with the new
<a href="sysman/timezone.htm">TimeZone</a> class to convert between
universal time and local time anywhere in the world, correctly
accounting for historical changes in time zone definitions and
daylight savings time.  This should be especially useful to authors
writing games involving time travel, or set during the early morning
hours on certain Sundays in March or November.

<li>The new function <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#makeList">makeList()</a>
constructs a list consisting of a repeated value.

<li>The system library's main startup code (in lib/_main.t) now allows
the main() function to omit the argument list parameter.  The library
now simply calls main() with as many arguments as it requires,
providing the standard "args" parameter if needed and otherwise
omitting it.  For little stand-alone programs that don't use the Adv3
library, this simplifies the code a little by letting you omit the
argument list parameter if you don't need it.

<li>Lists and vectors can now be converted to strings, explicitly with
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#toString">toString()</a> as well as in
contexts where non-string values are automatically coerced to strings,
such as on the right-hand side of a "+" operator where the left-hand
side is a string value.  The string representation of a list or vector
is the concatenation of its elements, each first converted to a string
itself if necessary, with commas separating elements.  For example,
toString([1, 2, 3]) is the string '1,2,3'.

<li>In implicit string conversions, the value <tt>true</tt> is now
acceptable, and is converted to the string 'true'.  In the past,
<tt>true</tt> worked this way with the
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#toString">toString</a> function, but not
in implicit string conversions (such as when a value is used on the
right-hand side of a "+" operator when the left-hand side is a
string: <tt>'x=' + true</tt> caused a run-time error in the past,
but now returns 'x=true').

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#toString">toString</a> function
and implicit string conversions now accept properties, function
pointers, pointers to built-in functions, and enum values.  If the
reflection services module (reflect.t) is included in the build, these
types will be passed to reflectionServices.valToSymbol() so that they
can be translated to symbols when possible.  If reflect.t isn't
included in the build, or if valToSymbol() doesn't return a string
value, these types will be represented using a default format that
indicates the value's type and an internal numeric identifier for the
value, such as "property#23" or "enum#17".  Any object type that
doesn't have a specialized string conversion defined by the built-in
object type is now handled the same way, so an object without special
formatting is represented either by its symbolic name (if it has one
and reflect.t is included in the build) or a generic "object#" format.

<li>The List method <a href="sysman/list.htm#sublist">sublist()</a>
now accepts negative <i>length</i> values, for better consistency with
similar methods (e.g., String.substr).  A negative length essentially
states the length relative to the end of the list, in that it gives
the number of elements to omit from the end of the result list.

<li>The <a href="sysman/pack.htm">byte packing language</a> now lets
you specify that a square-bracketed group is to be packed
from/unpacked into subgroups per iteration for a repeated item, rather
than using a single sublist for the whole group.  The "!"  modifier
makes this change.  For example, <tt>fp.unpackBytes('[L S C]5!')</tt>
returns (when successful) a list containing five sublists, each of
which contains the three unpacked elements from one group iteration (a
long int, a short int, and an 8-bit int).

<li>The byte packer now allows up-to counts (e.g., 'a10*') for packing
(not just unpacking).  When packing, for a group or a non-string item,
an up-to count packs up to the numeric limit, or up to the actual
number of arguments; for a string, an up-to count packs up to the
actual string length or up to the limit, truncating the string at the
limit if it's longer.

<li>The regular expression language accepts several new shorthand
character classes: %s for a space character, %S for a non-space
character, %d for a digit, %D for a non-digit, %v for a vertical
space, %V for a non vertical space.  (These correspond to backslash
sequences - \s, \D, etc - that are fairly standard these days in other
languages with regex parsers, such as Javascript and php.  There were
already &lt;xxx&gt; character classes that do the same things as these
new % codes, but these particular classes tend to be used often enough
that it's nice to have shorthand versions.)

<li>The new <a href="sysman/expr.htm#__objref">__objref()</a> operator
lets you test for the existence of a particular object symbol,
optionally generating a warning or error message if the symbol isn't
defined or is defined as something other than an object.  This is
similar to the <a href="sysman/expr.htm#defined">defined()</a>
operator, but is specialized for object references.

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#randomize">randomize()</a>
built-in function can do several new tricks.  First, it allows you to
select from three different RNG algorithms to use in
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rand">rand()</a>: the default ISAAC
algorithm (the original TADS 3 RNG), a Linear Congruential Generator
(or LCG, the long-time de facto standard for computer RNGs), and the
Mersenne Twister (a newer algorithm that's become popular in other
modern interpreted languages).  ISAAC is still a good general-purpose
choice, but the new options are there in case you have some reason to
prefer the properties of one of the other generators.  Second, you can
now set a fixed seed value.  This allows you to override the automatic
startup randomization that was added in TADS 3.1, and further lets you
start a new fixed sequence at any time.  Third, you can now save and
restore the state of the RNG, so that you can make the RNG repeat the
same sequence of results it produced from the time of the saved state.

<li>When the interpreter is launched, any command-line arguments that
follow the .t3 file name are passed to the program as string arguments
to the main() function.  In the past, these arguments were passed as-is,
without any character set translation, which caused unpredictable
results if they contained any non-ASCII characters.  The interpreter
now translates these strings from the local character set to Unicode,
ensuring that any accented letters or other non-ASCII characters are
interpreted properly.

(Related to <a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000109">bugdb.tads.org #0000109</a>)


<li>The new interpreter command-line option
<a href="sysman/terp.htm#-d-option">-d</a> specifies the default
directory for file input/output.  This is the directory that the File
object uses to open files whose names are specified with relative
paths.  If -d isn't specified, the default is the folder containing
the .t3 file.  (In past versions, there wasn't any way to set the
working directory, which was always the .t3 file's folder.  This means
the behavior in the absence of a -d option is the same as in the past.)

<p>The new option <a href="sysman/terp.htm#-sd-option">-sd</a> lets
you separately specify the "sandbox" directory for the file safety
feature.  In the absence of an -sd setting, the sandbox directory is
the same as -d setting, or simply the .t3 file's containing folder if
there's no -d option.

<p>(The -d option was added in part to address
<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000120">bugdb.tads.org #0000120</a>)


<li>A bug in the dynamic compiler caused 'if' statements in
dynamically compiled code (e.g., using <tt>new DynamicFunc()</tt>) to
use the 'then' branch code for both true and false outcomes.  This has
been fixed.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000117">bugdb.tads.org #0000117</a>)

<li>A bug in the dynamic compiler sometimes caused a run-time error when
accessing a local variable when the enclosing function also defined an
anonymous function.  This is now fixed.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000118">bugdb.tads.org #0000118</a>)

<li>A bug in the BigNumber class sporadically gave incorrect results
for additions.  (Specifically, results were sporadically off by one in
the last digit.)  This has been corrected.

<li>toInteger() caused a crash when used with values below 0.1.  This
has been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000127">bugdb.tads.org #0000127</a>)

<li>The compiler reported an unhelpful internal error message
("unsplicing invalid line") if a file ended in an unterminated string
literal.  The message is now the more explanatory "unterminated string
literal".

<li>Consider this macro definition and usage:

<p><pre>
#define ERROR(msg) tadsSay(#@msg)
ERROR({)
</pre>

<p>In the past, the compiler treated the ERROR({) line as have a
missing close paren.  This is because the compiler previously tried to
balance open and close curly braces and square brackets within macro
arguments, and treated any parentheses found nested within
braces or brackets as being part of the macro argument, rather than
terminating the macro argument.  This no longer occurs; parentheses
are now treated independently of braces and brackets within macro
arguments, so a close paren within a macro argument that doesn't match
an earlier open paren in the same argument now ends the argument.  The
example above thus now compiles without error, and expands to
<tt>tadsSay('{')</tt>.  The balancing act for braces and brackets does
still apply to commas, though: a comma within a pair of braces or
brackets is still considered part of the argument.  This is important
for macro arguments that contain things like statement blocks or
anonymous function definitions.

<li>The File unpackBytes() method incorrectly threw an error if an
"up-to" format was used (e.g., 'H20*') and the file had zero bytes
left to read.  This has been corrected; unpackBytes() now succeeds
and returns a zero-length result for the format item.

<li>String.split() incorrectly returned a one-element list (consisting
of an empty string) when used on an empty string.  This now correctly
returns an empty list.

<li>A bug in String.split() caused sporadic crashes when splitting
at a delimiter and the result list had more than 10 elements.  The
bug was related to garbage collection timing, so it was unpredictable.
This is now fixed.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000156">bugdb.tads.org #0000156</a>)

<li>A bug introduced in 3.1.0 caused exceptions to be caught in the
wrong handlers under certain rare conditions.  The problem happened
with exceptions thrown from within method calls when the caller had a
new "try" block starting immediately after the expression containing
the method call, with no other VM instructions between the call and
the start of the "try" block (this means, for example, that the return
value from the method call was discarded and no other computations
were performed as part of the same expression after the method call).
When all of these conditions were met, the exception was incorrectly
handled by the "catch" part of the "try" block that started just after
the call; this was incorrect because the "try" block didn't contain
the call and so its "catch" block shouldn't have been involved in
handling an exception that occurred within the call.  The correct
behavior has been restored.

<li>A bug in the regular expression parser randomly caused bad
behavior, including crashes, if the last character of an expression
string was outside of the ASCII range (Unicode code points 0 to 127).
The bug was only triggered when certain byte values happened to follow
the string in memory, so it only showed up rarely even for expression
strings matching the description.  (It was also possible to trigger
the same bug with a non-ASCII character within five characters of the
last position if the string ended with an incomplete &lt;Xxx&gt;
character class name, lacking the final "&gt;", but this might have
been too improbable to have ever been observed in the wild.)  This has
been fixed.

<li>A compiler bug introduced in 3.1.0 made it impossible to assign
to an indexed "self" element in a modifier method for an intrinsic
class such as List or Vector.  This has been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000128">bugdb.tads.org #0000128</a>)

<li>In the past, the compiler attempted to pre-evaluate any indexing
expression it encountered ("a[b]") where the index value and the value
being indexed were both constants.  In such cases, it only recognized
list indexing, which was the only valid constant indexing expression
before operator overloading made it possible to define indexing on
custom object classes.  This made the compiler generate error messages
for (potentially) valid code involving constant index values applied
to object names.  This has been corrected; the compiler now treats
such expressions as valid, and defers their evaluation until run-time,
so that any operator overloading can be properly applied.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000142">bugdb.tads.org #0000142</a>)


<li>The standard main window layout code in the Web UI library now
loads its Flash helper object (TADS.SWF) dynamically rather than
statically, and only does so when it detects that Flash support is
already present in the browser.  In the past, the TADS.SWF object was
embedded statically on the page, which means that the browser saw the
object declaration whether or not Flash support was installed.  Some
browsers attempt to be helpful in this situation by popping up a
dialog or prompt pointing out that the page depends on Flash and
offering to download and install a Flash plug-in.  For users who
intentionally omit Flash from their browser configurations, though,
this "helpful" prompt is an annoyance, since it comes up every time a
page with a Flash embedding is loaded or reloaded and the answer is
always No.  The library's new approach avoids the superfluous prompt
by creating the TADS.SWF object embedding only after determining that
Flash is already installed.

<p>(There's a trade-off, of course, in that the browsers that display
the prompt do so for good reason.  Without it, users who
<i>un</i>intentionally omitted Flash from their configurations will
never know the page makes use of it.  This seems like a small price to
pay, though, in that (a) most modern browsers include Flash support
out of the box anyway (excluding those on iOS, where Flash simply
isn't available), so practically everyone who hasn't gone out of their
way to remove Flash already has it (or is running on iOS, where
there's no need for a prompt since there's no way to install Flash at
all); and (b) even if there's anyone left over after considering (a)
who could benefit from the prompt, the Web UI only uses Flash as a
very minor enhancement (specifically, to obtain a list of installed
fonts for the Preferences dialog), so these presumably rare users
won't suffer any really significant loss of functionality from the
lack of Flash that we're preventing the browser from alerting them
to.)

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000145">bugdb.tads.org #0000145</a>)


<li>The compiler didn't generate the full string list properly when
the -Os option was used; only strings for the first source module in
the build were included, rather than strings for all modules being
compiled.  (What's more, when the build included many modules, the
underlying bug sometimes caused internal memory corruptions within the
compiler that generated spurious error messages or other unpredictable
results.)  This has been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000150">bugdb.tads.org #0000150</a>)


</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.1.0 (December 21, 2011)</h3>


<p>This update has three main themes: dynamic coding, greater
convenience, and network support.  On the dynamic code side, it's now
possible to compile new code at run-time, and new reflection features
provide more thorough run-time access to the program's own internal
structure.  These dynamic features will be especially interesting to
library and extension authors, as they open new opportunities for
creating miniature languages within the language.  The convenience
enhancements involve numerous, mostly small changes that make common
tasks easier and frequent coding patterns more compact.  As for
the new network features, the original motivation and initial
application is to run TADS games in a client/server configuration,
where the player uses an ordinary browser to access the game, with no
need to install TADS or even download a game file.  This is just one
application of the new technology, though; the network features are
actually much more generalized and extensive than this first use might
suggest.  In effect, TADS is now capable of acting as a fairly
complete (if small scale) Web server programming environment.  This
opens many new possibilities for networked user interfaces and
multi-player games.  It also has an interesting bonus benefit, which
is that it lets you tap into the full power of the browser to create
your TADS user interfaces.  Modern browsers provide a vastly more
powerful user interface platform than HTML TADS (or any other existing
IF runtime), and all of that power is now directly available to TADS
games.

<p>Note that before this version was released, it was sometimes
referred to as 3.0.19 (e.g., in the TADS bug database and the T3
blog).  If you're looking for 3.0.19 based on something you read
elsewhere, this is it.  We finally bumped the name up to 3.1 because
of the substantial new functionality it contains.


<ul>

<li><b>Compatibility Alerts:</b> The following changes might affect
existing code that was originally created with an earlier version of
TADS 3.

<ul>

   <li><tt>operator</tt> is now a reserved word, due to the new operator
   overloading feature.  This means that the word <tt>operator</tt> can't
   used as a symbol name, such as for the name of an object, function, or
   local variable.

   <li><tt>method</tt> is now a reserved word, due to the new "floating"
   method definition syntax.

   <li><tt>invokee</tt> is now a reserved word.

   <li><tt>defined</tt> is now a reserved word.

   <li>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; sequences are now meaningful in single-quoted
   strings, since these strings can now contain expression embeddings.
   This means that formerly inert &lt;&lt; sequences in single-quoted
   strings will now be interpreted as embeddings.  This <i>should</i>
   be a compatibility issue, but as it happens a fortuitous
   compiler bug in older versions made it virtually impossible to use
   &lt;&lt; in single-quoted strings anyway, so this shouldn't affect
   any existing code.

   <li>Complex expressions involving compound assignment operators
   with side effects in their lvalues are now compiled with different
   (better)
   behavior.  This probably won't affect any existing code,
   because (a) it only applies to fairly unusual expressions, and (b) anyone
   who encountered the old behavior probably would have thought it was
   a bug and changed their code to avoid it.
   The new behavior is much more predictable and much more what you'd
   expect, but it's possible that there's existing code that accidentally
   relies on the old behavior.
   Details <a href="#compoundAsiSideEffects">below</a>.

   <li>The regular expression character class &lt;space&gt; now
   explicitly matches only <i>horizontal</i> whitespace characters,
   <i>not</i> vertical separators (\n, \r, \b, and a few others).
   This is actually more likely to fix problems than create new ones,
   since the old behavior was inconsistent with what most people
   expect from other regular expression implementations.

   <li>The rand() function now evaluates only one of its arguments
   when it's called with multiple arguments.  In the past, rand() 
   evaluated all of its argument values first, then randomly selected
   one of the values as the result.  Now, rand() makes the random selection
   first, then evaluates only the selected item, and returns the result.
   This means that side effects are only triggered for the selected
   argument, not for all arguments as in the past.  This could conceivably
   affect existing code that relied on all of the arguments' side effects
   being executed, although such code tends to be tricky enough that
   most people avoid it, so the practical impact should be minimal to
   non-existent.  Also, importantly, this is a <b>compiler</b>
   change only, so it only affects newly compiled code; existing .t3
   files already in distribution won't be affected.

</ul>

<li>It's now possible for a TADS game to be a Web server.  This is
accomplished with the new intrinsic classes <a
href="sysman/httpsrv.htm">HTTPServer</a>, which handles the low-level
networking required to receive and parse HTTP requests from Web
clients, and <a href="sysman/httpreq.htm">HTTPRequest</a>, which
represents an incoming HTTP request from a client; and the new
intrinsic function set <a href="sysman/tadsnet.htm">tads-net</a>,
which contains additional support functions for networking operations.

<p>The new HTTP server support classes are designed to automatically
handle all of the low-level necessities of a network service, while
still giving the game program full control over how requests are
actually processed.  This makes it possible to create a wide variety
of effects with the network server.  Initially, it will be used to
present the traditional single-player user interface in a networked
configuration, where the game runs on a server and the client needs
only an ordinary Web browser.  This eliminates the need for clients to
install the TADS software, while also greatly expanding the UI
capabilities of TADS games by letting you use the full power of HTML
DOM and Javascript.  Over time, it opens up lots of other
possibilities, such as collaborative gaming and multi-player games.

<li>In addition to the new ability to act as a Web server, TADS games
can now also make HTTP requests as clients, via the new function
<a href="sysman/tadsnet.htm#sendNetRequest">sendNetRequest()</a>.
This lets a game send information to and receive information from
remote Internet servers during play.

<li>The interpreter has a new command-line option, <tt>-ns##</tt>, for
setting the "network safety level".  This is analogous to the file
safety level, and controls the program's ability to access the network
functions.  The "##" part is two digits, the first giving the safety
level for <i>client</i> functions, and the second giving the level for
<i>server</i> functions.  The client level controls outgoing
connections from the program to external network services; the server
level controls the program's ability to accept connections from
external client programs (such as Web browsers).  There are three
possible values for each component: 0 means "no safety", which allows
all network access without restrictions; 1 sets local access only,
which only allows connections to or from other applications running on
the same computer; and 2 is "maximum safety", meaning no network
access is allowed at all.  For example, <tt>-ns02</tt> gives the
program full access as a client to any external network service
anywhere on the network, but at the same time prohibits the program
from setting up any network services of its own or accepting any
connections from other processes or computers.  The default safety
level is <tt>-ns11</tt>, which allows the program to connect to and
accept connections from other programs on the same machine only.

<li>The compiler now accepts "triple-quoted" strings.  This
<i>isn't</i> a third type of string beyond single- and double-quoted;
it's just a new way of writing those two existing string types.  A few
other C-like languages have adopted this as a nicer syntax for writing
strings that contain quote marks as part of their literal text.  This
is a particularly common need in TADS, since so many strings are
part of the story text.

<p>A triple-quoted string starts and ends with <i>three copies</i> of
the quote mark.  What you gain is that you can then freely use the
quote mark character within the string <i>without</i> worrying about
"escaping" it with a backslash.  The traditional C backslash syntax
for embedded quotes is awkward to type and hard to read.  Triple
quotes make strings more readable by letting you use quotes directly
in a string without any escape characters.

<p>
<pre>
   desc = """The sign reads "Beware of Backslash!""""
</pre>

<p>There are a couple of subtleties you should be aware of, so
take a look at the <a href="sysman/strlit.htm#tripleQuotes">System
Manual</a> for details.

<li>Single-quoted strings can now use &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; expression
embeddings (including all of the new embedding features, such as
&lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt;).  The single-quoted version produces a
result that's equivalent to concatenating the embedded expressions
to the surrounding string fragments.  For example, <tt>'one
&lt;&lt;two&gt;&gt; three &lt;&lt;four&gt;&gt; five'</tt> is
equivalent to <tt>'one ' + two + ' three ' + four + ' five'</tt>.  See
<a href="sysman/strlit.htm#embedSgl">String Literals</a> in the System
Manual for more details.

<li>A new <a href="sysman/strlit.htm#strtpl">string embedding
template</a> syntax lets you create custom keywords and phrases
for use inside embedded
expressions.  The compiler translates each custom template invocation
into a function call, so this is merely a syntactic convenience, but
it can make embeddings in strings more readable by avoiding
expression-like syntax.  For example, you could create
a template that lets you write a string like "You currently have
&lt;&lt;score in words&gt;&gt;" points", rather than the
more techy looking "You currently have &lt;&lt;spellNum(score)&gt;&gt;
points".

<li>There's a powerful new string embedding syntax for writing
passages that vary according to run-time conditions.  Traditionally,
conditions were embedded in strings using the <tt>?:</tt> operator, as in:

<p><pre>
   desc = "The door is &lt;&lt;isOpen ? 'open' : 'closed'&gt;&gt;."
</pre>

<p>That's fine for substituting a word or two based on a simple
true/false condition, but for anything more complex it can be
hard to read.  The new syntax improves the situation
by making the varying text part
of the string, rather than part of the expression.  The conditions
become almost like markups interposed within the text:

<p><pre>
   desc = "The door is &lt;&lt;if isOpen&gt;&gt;open&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;closed&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. "
</pre>

<p>The improved readability of the new syntax is more obvious with
longer passages:

<p><pre>
   desc = "A massive iron door, bristling with rivets and bolts
     across its surface. &lt;&lt;if isOpen&gt;&gt;It's open a crack, leaving
     enough room for a mouse or perhaps a small hare to slip
     through, but probably not quite enough for a burly
     adventurer. "
</pre>

<p>Another benefit of the new syntax is that, because the varying text
is part of the string rather than part of an embedding, you can freely
use additional embeddings within the then/else parts.  (That's not
possible with <tt>?:</tt> embeddings, since strings inside embedded
expressions can't themselves contain any embeddings.)  You can even
nest &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; structures for more complex conditions.

<p>As with other embedding syntax, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; can be used
in single-quoted strings as well.

<p>Full details are in the
<a href="sysman/strlit.htm#embeddedIf">System Manual</a>.

<li>Another new embedding syntax,
<a href="sysman/strlit.htm#oneof">&lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt;</a>, makes it
easier to create lists of alternative messages to be chosen randomly
or in a cycle (or a combination of the two).
&lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt; variations are defined
for simple random selection, shuffling, cycling, "stop" lists,
and for various combinations of these, such as going through a
list once in sequence and then shuffling it.

<p>The traditional way to create random or sequential messages
was via the Adv3 EventList class, which of course
still works.  &lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt; is much
more concise and readable for simple message variations, though, since
it doesn't require a separate object declaration for the event list.
The new syntax also has the advantage of being nestable inside
other &lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt; structures and &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt
structures.

<li>One more new special embedding:
<a href="sysman/strlit.htm#firstTimeOnly">&lt;&lt;first time&gt;&gt;</a>
shows a message the first time the enclosing string is displayed,
and omits it after that.  This is really just a special case of
&lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt; (and, in fact, the compiler actually
rewrites it that way), but it's such a common motif in IF authoring
that the custom syntax seems justified.

<li>Speaking of string embedding, the compiler now respects
parentheses (and square brackets and curly braces) within an embedded
expression when determining where it ends.  The compiler previously
assumed an embedding ended at the very first &gt;&gt;, regardless
of context, but this
was problematic if you wanted to use the &gt;&gt; bit-shift operator within an
expression.  Now, the compiler counts parentheses, brackets, and
braces, and treats &gt;&gt; as a bit-shift operator if it
appears within a bracketed group.  This means you can use the &gt;&gt;
operator in an embedded expression simply by parenthesizing the expression.

<li>The new TadsObject methods getMethod() and setMethod() give you
more dynamic control over objects and classes by letting you add new
methods to an existing object.  This makes it possible to perform
almost any sort of transformation on an object.  See the
<a href="sysman/tadsobj.htm">TadsObject documentation</a> for details.

<li>The new <tt>method</tt> keyword lets you define a "floating"
method.  This is a routine that's not associated with an object, but
which nonetheless has access to the method context variables
(targetprop, targetobj, definingobj, and self), as well as
<tt>inherited</tt>.  This is meant specifically for use with
TadsObject.setMethod(): it lets you create a method that's not
intially part of any object, and then plug it in as an actual method
of selected objects at run-time.  Syntactically, a floating method
definition looks just like an ordinary function definition, except
that whole thing is preceded by the keyword <tt>method</tt> instead of
the optional <tt>function</tt> keyword.  See the System Manual for <a
href="sysman/proccode.htm#floatingMethods">more details</a>.

<p>The <tt>method</tt> keyword can also be used to create anonymous
methods.  These look and act almost the same as anonymous functions.
The difference is that an anonymous method doesn't share its
method context variables (self, definingobj, targetobj, targetprop)
with its enclosing lexical scope.  Instead, an anonymous method takes
on the "live" values for those variables each time it's called.
As with named floating methods, anonymous methods are designed for
attaching to objects via setMethod().
<a href="sysman/anonfn.htm#anonMethods">Details</a> are in the
System Manual.


<li>The new intrinsic class <a
href="sysman/dynfunc.htm">DynamicFunc</a> makes it possible for a
running program to extend itself by creating new code on the fly.  New
code is created by compiling a string that contains source code text,
just as you'd use in the main program source code.  This type of
facility is common in modern interpreted languages, especially
scripting languages (e.g., Javascript, PHP), where people have found
all sorts of uses for it.  It's especially interesting in TADS because
it opens the door to new string and message processing capabilities.

<p>DynamicFunc values behave very much like ordinary function pointers.
You can call a DynamicFunc as though it were a function pointer, and
you can use a DynamicFunc in TadsObject.setMethod() to create a new
method for an object.

<li><a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">GrammarProd</a> objects can now be
dynamically created, and the grammar rules for an existing GrammarProd
can be modified at run-time.  The new methods deleteAlt() and
clearAlts() remove existing alternatives from a GrammarProd, and the
new method addAlt() adds new alternatives.  New rules are specified
using the same syntax as the regular "grammar" statement.

<li>It's now possible to retrieve information on the preprocessor
macros defined by the compiled program.  This is handled through the
existing function <a
href="sysman/t3vm.htm#t3GetGlobalSymbols">t3GetGlobalSymbols()</a>,
which now takes an optional argument value that selects which type of
symbol information to retrieve.  The argument is one of the following
constant values: T3GlobalSymbols, to retrieve the global symbol table;
or T3PreprocMacros, to retrieve the macro symbol table.  If you don't
include an argument, the global symbol table is retrieved as in the
past, so existing code will work unchanged.  As with the symbol table,
the macro table is available only during preinit, or during normal
run-time if the program is compiled with debugging information.

<li>It's now possible to get a pointer to an intrinsic (built-in)
function.  Use the "&amp;" operator, just like with a property name.
For example, <tt>&amp;tadsSay</tt> yields a pointer to the tadsSay()
intrinsic.  These pointers operate just like ordinary function
pointers: you can use them to make calls, and you can even use them
in TadsObject.setMethod().

<li>For syntactic consistency, the "&amp;" operator can now be used to
get a pointer to an ordinary function.

<p>(In the past this wasn't allowed, but only for nit-picky
reasons.  It was felt that, because there wasn't a <i>need</i>
for an explicit "pointer-to" operator for functions, "&amp;" shouldn't
even be allowed for functions, making its function clearer by virtue
of being single-purpose.  This was seen as worthwhile because "pointer
to property" seems to be a particularly subtle idea for new users, as
it's rather abstract and not common in other languages.  However, now
that we have pointers to built-in functions, we <i>do</i> need an
explicit "pointer to" operator for those, and "&amp;" is certainly the
right choice: it's the right parallel to C++, on which our syntax was
originally modeled, and it's the right analogy to the existing TADS
usage of "&amp;" with properties.  With the addition of the
built-in function pointer type, given that "&amp;<i>property</i>" means
"pointer to <i>property</i>", and "&amp;<i>built-in</i>" means
"pointer to <i>built-in</i>," it would be confusing if
"&amp;<i>function</i>" didn't mean "pointer to function" as well.  The
only thing left out, really is "&amp;<i>object</i>", but that would be
going too far.  The analogy with C++ would make "&amp;<i>object</i>"
confusing for experienced C++ users because <i>object</i> and
&amp;<i>object</i> have quite different meanings in that language.)

<li>The new "defined" operator tests at compile time to determine
whether a symbol is defined or not.  The syntax is
<tt>defined(</tt><i>symbol</i><tt>)</tt>; this yields the constant
value <tt>true</tt> if <i>symbol</i> is defined at the <b>global</b>
level within the program (as a function, object, or property name),
<tt>nil</tt> if not.  You can use <tt>defined()</tt> in any
expression context, such as in the condition of an <tt>if</tt> statement.
This operator is particularly useful in libraries, since it makes it
possible to write code that conditionally references objects only
when they're actually part of the program.  See the
<a href="sysman/expr.htm#defined">System Manual</a> for details.

<p>Note that "defined" still has its separate meaning within
#if preprocessor expressions.  There, the operator determines if
the symbol is defined as a <b>preprocessor</b> (#define) symbol.
When used outside of #if expressions, "defined" has the
new meaning of testing the symbol's presence in the compiler
global symbols rather than the preprocessor macro symbols.

<li>The "new" keyword is no longer required (although it's still
allowed) in the definition of a long-form anonymous function.  For
example, it's now valid to write code like <tt>lst.mapAll(function(x)
{ return x+1; })</tt>.  The presence or absence of the "new" makes no
difference to the meaning.

<p>The original rationale for requiring "new" was that anonymous
functions are actually objects that are newly created on each
evaluation, so it was felt that this should be made explicit in the
syntax.  The rationale for now relaxing the "new" requirement is that
"closures" (as they're more technically known) have become common in
other mainstream languages, and no one else seems to think the syntax
should mimic object construction.  (For that matter, TADS's own
short-form syntax never had the "new".)  There's also a good
pragmatic reason: with the new Web UI, TADS programmers might find
themselves switching back and forth between TADS and Javascript,
since the Web UI incorporates a substantial Javascript front end.
Javascript's anonymous function syntax is almost exactly like TADS's
long-form syntax, except that Javascript doesn't have the "new".  Such
close-but-not-perfect similarities are particularly vexing
when switching between languages, so it seemed best to eliminate the
unnecessary difference.

<li>Short-form anonymous functions can now define their own local
variables.  Use the <tt>local</tt> keyword as usual, at the beginning
of the function's expression.  The syntax is analogous to defining
locals within a <tt>for</tt> statement's initializer clause.  See <a
href="sysman/anonfn.htm#shortFormLocals">Anonymous Functions</a> in
the System Manual for details and examples.

<p>This is convenient because it lets you use the short-form
syntax even if the function requires a local variable or two.  In the
past, you had to switch to the long-form syntax to define a local,
even if the rest of the function simply returned an expression value.

<li>The syntax of the <tt>for</tt> loop has been extended with
three new features:

<ul>
   <li><b>for..in:</b>:
   <tt>for (x in collection)</tt> is now synonymous with the
   existing <tt>foreach</tt> syntax.  This makes the syntax more
   uniform, which makes the language easier to use by eliminating
   the need to remember to use distinct keywords for the two kinds
   of loops.

   <li><b>Hybrid for and for..in loops:</b> The "in" syntax newly
   allowed in <tt>for</tt> loops can also be combined with the
   conventional three-part init/condition/update syntax.  This
   allows you to add other looping variables to an "in" iteration.
   One of the drawbacks of the <tt>foreach</tt> syntax is that any
   other looping variables have to be initialized before the <tt>foreach</tt>
   and updated and/or tested within the loop body.  <tt>for</tt> loops,
   in contrast, can manage multiple variables as part of explicit
   loop structure within the <tt>for</tt> statement itself, which
   is more compact and often clearer.  For example, to add a counter
   to an "in" loop, and stop after 10 iterations even if more
   elements are in the list, you could write
   <tt>for (local i = 1, local ele in list ; i < 10 ; ++i) { }</tt>.

   <li><b>for..in range loops:</b> By far the most common type of
   <tt>for</tt> loop is a simple iteration over a range of integers,
   such as over the index range for a list.  There's now a custom
   syntax for this kind of loop: <tt>for (<i>var</i> in <i>from</i>
   .. <i>to</i>)</tt>.  This syntax steps the variable <i>var</i>
   from the <i>from</i> expression's value to the <i>to</i>
   expression's value, inclusive of the limits.  For example, to
   step through the index values for a list, you can write
   <tt>for (local i in 1..list.length())</tt>.  This new syntax
   makes simple integer loops easier to write and clearer.  It
   also makes them more reliable, since a common coding error
   is using <tt>&lt;</tt> instead of <tt>&lt;=</tt> (or vice
   versa) for a loop condition.  The range syntax is more intuitive
   because it explicitly states the endpoints rather than expressing
   the loop condition as a value comparison.  The new syntax also
   allows specifying the increment: <tt>for (i in 0..20 step 2)</tt>
   steps through even numbers, and <tt>for (i in 10..1 step -1)</tt>
   steps down from 10 to 1.  As with collection loops, you can mix
   this syntax with the full three-part <tt>for</tt> syntax:
   <tt>for (local i in 1..20, sum = 0 ; lst[i] != nil ; sum += lst[i])</tt>.

</ul>

<p>The new syntax is described in more detail in the <a
href="sysman/proccode.htm#for">System Manual</a>.

<li>A new language feature lets you pass argument values to functions
and methods using explicit argument names.  This has several important
benefits.  First, callees can retrieve argument values from callers
without regard to the order of the values in the calling expression.
Second, callees are free to ignore named parameters entirely, which
allows a caller to pass extra, optional context information without
burdening every callee's method definition syntax with unneeded extra
parameter declarations.  Third, nested callees can retrieve named
arguments passed indirectly from a caller several levels removed, so
intermediate functions that don't care about context information can
ignore it without preventing nested callees from accessing it.  This
doesn't replace the traditional positional argument system, but rather
extends it.  Some other languages use named arguments primarily for
code clarity reasons, but the TADS version is designed to address a
particular coding problem that comes up time and again in IF library
design.  The details take a little work to explain; the new System
Manual chapter on <a href="sysman/namedargs.htm">Named Arguments</a>
has the full story.

<li>New syntax makes it easier to define functions and methods that
take optional arguments.  It's always been possible to do something
similar using the "..." syntax, but "..." is really intended for cases
where the number of additional arguments is unpredictable and has no
fixed upper limit.  The new syntax, in contrast, is for cases where
you have a specific number of arguments, but where you wish to make
one or more of the arguments optional, so that callers can omit them
for the most common case where a default value would apply.  This
makes the calling syntax more convenient for the common case, while
still letting callers specify the full details when needed.  "..."
isn't ideal for this use because it doesn't provide error checking for
<i>too many</i> parameters, and because it requires fairly tedious
extra syntax in the callee to check for the presence of the extra
arguments and retrieve their values.  The new syntax is described in
detail in the new System Manual chapter on <a
href="sysman/optparams.htm">optional parameters</a>.

<li>The new <a href="sysman/expr.htm#invokee"><tt>invokee</tt></a>
pseudo-variable retrieves a pointer to the function currently executing.
This is most useful for anonymous functions, since it provides a way
for an anonymous function to invoke itself recursively.

<li>The t3GetStackTrace() function can now retrieve information on the
local variables in effect at each stack level.  The locals are
available via the locals_ property of the T3StackInfo object that
represents a stack level.

<p>By default, locals are omitted, since they take additional time to
retrieve.  To include local variable information, supply the new
<i>flags</i> argument with the value T3GetStackLocals.  (This is a bit
value; it's possible that future bit values will be added, in which
case this will be combinable with other bit flags via the '|'
operator.)

<p>The locals in each stack frame are provided as a LookupTable.  Each
element of the table is keyed by a string giving the name of the
variable, and each corresponding table value is the current value of
the local.  The table is merely a copy of the locals in the stack,
a value in the table won't have any effect on the local variables
themselves.

<li>The t3GetStackTrace() function now includes information on the
named arguments passed to each stack frame.  This is available via
the namedArgs_ property of the T3StackInfo object that represents
each stack level.  This property is nil for a stack level that
doesn't have named arguments.

<p>Each named argument list is provided as a LookupTable.  Each element
of the table is keyed by a string giving the name of the argument,
and each corresponding table value is the argument's value.  

<li>The t3GetStackTrace() function now includes full information on
"native" calls in the stack - that is, intrinsic functions and
intrinsic class methods.  In the past, native callers were recognizable
by their complete lack of information, in that they had a nil value
for both the calling function and object/property values.

<p>This change comes into play when a native routine calls bytecode
via a function pointer you passed into the native routine, such as
when List.forEach() invokes its callback.  When the native caller is a
built-in function, the function pointer element of the stack level
object will contain a built-in function pointer value; when it's an
intrinsic class method, it will contain suitable object and property
values describing the native method.  For obvious reasons, there's no
source file information for a native routine in the stack trace.

<li>The new intrinsic class StackFrameDesc provides read and write
access to the local variables in a stack frame.  You obtain a
StackFrameDesc object via t3GetStackTrace() by including the
T3GetStackDesc flag.  The object provides methods to get and set the
values of local variables, and to retrieve the method context
variables (self, targetobj, targetprop, definingobj).  See the System
Manual chapter for <a href="sysman/framedesc.htm">more information</a>.

<li>A new language and VM feature make it possible to "overload"
operators.  This means that you can define a method on an object or
class that's invoked using one of the algebraic operator symbols, such
as "+" or "*", rather than via the normal method call syntax.
Operator overloading has many potential uses, but the two main uses
are (1) to create an especially compact syntax for common operations
on specialized objects, and (2) to create a custom object that mimics
the low-level interface of one of the built-in types or classes.  The
details are described more fully in a <a
href="sysman/opoverload.htm">new chapter</a> in the system manual.

<p>Operator overloading has three significant limitations.  First, you
can't <i>override</i> operators pre-defined by intrinsic classes.  For
example, you can't redefine the indexing operator "[]" for a List, or
the concatenation operator "+" for a String.  You can, however,
<i>add</i> operators to intrinsic classes: it's legal to use "modify"
to define an operator on an intrinsic class as long as that operator
isn't already defined by the intrinsic class itself.  Second, there's
no way to overload operators at all for a primitive type like integer,
whether or not the type defines it: you can't change the meaning of
"+" when applied to integers, or add a meaning for "true + nil".
Third, not all operators are overloadable; notably, none of the
comparison operators (==, !=, &lt;, &lt=, &gt;, &gt=) are
overloadable.  All of these limitations are due to performance
considerations; with these restrictions in place, this new feature has
no performance cost to programs that don't use it.

<li>Using operator overloading, it's now possible to create
"list-like" objects.  An object is considered list-like if it has an
overload for <tt>operator[]</tt> <i>and</i> it provides a
<tt>length()</tt> method that takes zero arguments.  If the object
provides this interface, the <tt>length()</tt> method <b>must</b>
return an integer value.

<p>The following built-in functions that formerly only accepted
regular lists and/or vectors will now also accept list-like objects:
inputDialog(), makeString(), rand(), Dictionary.addWord(),
Dictionary.removeWord(), List.intersect(), List.appendUnique(), new
LookupTable(), GrammarProd.parseTokens(), new StringComparator(),
TadsObject.setSuperclassList(), new Vector(), Vector.appendAll(),
Vector.appendUnique(), Vector.copyFrom().  Similarly, the "..."
varying argument expansion operator can be applied to a list-like
object as though it were a true list; and List and Vector comparisons
with "==" and "!=" will compare element-by-element against a list-like
value on the right-hand side; and the List and Vector "+" and "-"
operators will treat right-hand operands as lists if they're list-like
objects.

<li>New syntax lets you create a LookupTable directly from a set of
Key/Value pairs.  The syntax is similar to a list expression: write
the list of Key-&gt;Value pairs in square brackets, with an arrow
symbol '-&gt;' between each key and value.  For example, <tt>x =
['one'-&gt;1, 'two'-&gt;2, 'three'-&gt;3]</tt> creates a LookupTable
with keys 'one', 'two', and 'three', corresponding to values 1, 2, and
3, so x['one'] yields 1, and so on.  This syntax is equivalent to
calling <tt>new LookupTable()</tt> and then filling in the keyed
values, so this kind of expression creates a new LookupTable object
each time it's evaluated.

<li>The LookupTable class now lets you specify the value to be returned
when you index a table with a key that doesn't exist in the table.
This is called the "default value" for the table; in the past, this
was always nil.  The new <tt>setDefaultValue()</tt> method lets you
set a different default.  You can retrieve the default value
previously set for a table with the new <tt>getDefaultValue()</tt>
method.  The initial default value for a new table is nil, so the
behavior is the same as in prior versions if you don't use the new
method.  You can also specify the default value when creating a table
with the new shorthand syntax, by writing
"<tt>*-&gt;<i>value</i></tt>" as the last element of the list.  (The
asterisk is meant to suggest a "wildcard" matching any key not
specifically entered in the table.)

<li>The Dictionary class has new built-in infrastructure support for
spelling correctors.  The new function correctSpelling() retrieves a
list of words in the dictionary that are within a specified "edit
distance" of a given string.  This new function isn't a full-fledged
spelling corrector, but provides a very fast version of a key
infrastructure element for building one.  Refer to the <a
href="sysman/dict.htm#spellingCorrection">Dictionary class
documentation</a> for details.

<li>The new intrinsic class <a
href="sysman/strbuf.htm">StringBuffer</a> is a mutable version of the
character string object.  Unlike regular String objects, a
StringBuffer's text contents can be modified in place, without
creating new String objects.  StringBuffer is designed especially for
situations where it takes many incremental steps to build a string.
It's much more efficient to use StringBuffer for these cases than it
is to use regular string concatenation, because the latter makes a new
copy of each concatenated combination.  StringBuffer provides methods
to edit the contents of the buffer: you can insert, append, delete,
and replace parts of the text.  When you've finished the build steps
for a string buffer, you can convert it to a regular string using
toString().  You can also extract a substring of the buffer using the
substr() method, just like for a regular string.

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rexReplace">rexReplace()</a>
function has several new features that make it more powerful
and more convenient to use:

<ul>

   <li>You can now specify a function to determine the replacement
text to use for each match.  If you supply a function (regular or
anonymous) in place of the regular replacement text argument,
rexReplace() calls the function for each match, passing as arguments
the matched text, the index of the match within the overall subject
string, and the original subject string.  Your callback function
returns a string value giving the text to use as the replacement.
This allows for much more complex string manipulations, since you can
test conditions that are beyond what can be encoded in a regular
expression, and you can apply arbitrary transformations to the match
string to produce the replacement text.

   <li>You can now specify a list of patterns to match, instead of
just a single pattern, and each pattern can have a separate
replacement value (which can be a string or a callback function, per
the new callback feature above).  By default, when you supply a list
of patterns, rexReplace() searches for all of the patterns at once.
This is similar to combining the patterns with '|' to make a single
pattern, but it's more powerful because it lets you specify a
different replacement string for each pattern.  If you include
ReplaceSerial in the flags, rexReplace() instead searches "serially"
for the patterns: it replaces each occurrence of the first pattern
throughout the entire string, and then re-scans the updated string to
replace all occurrences of the second pattern, and so on.  The effect
is the same as calling rexReplace() sequentially with each individual
pattern, but it's more compact to write it this way.

   <li>The "flags" argument is now optional.  If it's omitted,
the default is ReplaceAll.  This makes the function more convenient
to use for the most common case.  Note that if you need to specify
the "index" argument, you must also include a "flags" value, since
the arguments are positional.

   <li>The new flag ReplaceIgnoreCase makes the search insensitive to
case, by default.  A &lt;case&gt; or &lt;case&gt; directive in the
regular expression overrides the ReplaceIgnoreCase setting.  The main
reason this flag is provided at all (given that it's largely redundant
with the &lt;case&gt; or &lt;case&gt; directives) is for uniformity
with String.findReplace(), but it can occasionally be useful in that
lets you reuse an expression for both case-sensitive and
case-insensitive searches.

   <li>The new flag ReplaceFollowCase makes the replacement follow the
capitalization pattern of the matched text.  Lower-case letters in the
replacement text are capitalized (or not) as follows: if all of the
alphabetic characters in the matched text are capitals, the entire
replacement text is capitalized; if all of the letters in the match
are lower-case, the replacement text is left in lower-case; if the
match has both capitals and lower-case letters, the first alphabetic
character of the replacement text is capitalized.  This only applies
to lower-case letters in a replacement string, and only to literal
text: "%" group substitutions aren't affected, since they already copy
text directly from the match anyway.  The flag also has no effect when
the replacement is a callback function rather than a string; we have
to assume the function returns exactly what it wants, since it can
perform similar case manipulations of its own.

</ul>

<li>The String method <a
href="sysman/string.htm#findReplace">findReplace()</a> has a few new
features:

<ul>

   <li>You can now specify a list of search strings, and a list of
corresponding replacements.  This makes it possible to perform a whole
series of replacements with a single call.

   <li>You can now pass a function in place of a string as the
replacement argument.  For each match, findReplace() invokes the
function, passing in the matched text and other information;
the function returns a string giving the replacement text.  This
makes it possible to vary the replacement according to the actual
matched text, its position in the subject string, or other factors.

   <li>The "flags" argument is now optional.  If it's omitted, the
default is ReplaceAll.  This makes the most common usage more
convenient.  Note that if you need to specify an "index" value
(for the starting position), you'll need to include a "flags"
value, since the arguments are positional.

   <li>The new flag ReplaceIgnoreCase makes the search insensitive
to capitalization.

   <li>The new flag ReplaceFollowCase makes the replacement text
follow the case of the matched text, mimicking its capitalization
pattern.

</ul>

<li>The functions rexMatch(), rexSearch(), and rexReplace(), and the
String methods toUnicode(), find(), and findReplace() now accept a
negative values for the "index" argument.  This is taken as an index
from the end of the string: -1 is the last character, -2 the second to
last, and so on.  For the search and replace functions, a negative
index doesn't change the left-to-right order of the search; it's
simply a convenience for specifying the starting point.  Some other
string methods already accepted this notation, so these additions make
the API more consistent.

<li>The regular expression matcher now matches &lt;space&gt; only to
<i>horizontal</i> whitespace characters.  In the past, &lt;space&gt;
matched some vertical whitespace characters as well, but this was
inconsistent with the usual matching rules in most other regular
expression implementations, and was usually undesirable.  The new
character type &lt;vspace&gt; explicitly matches vertical whitespace:
'\n', '\r', '\b', '\u2028', '\u2029', and a few ASCII control
characters that the Unicode standard defines as line break characters
('\u0085', '\u001C', '\u001D', '\u001E').  To create a character
class matcher that matches all whitespace, the way &lt;space&gt;
did in the past, use &lt;space|vspace&gt;.

<li>Look-back <a href="sysman/regex.htm#assertions">assertions</a> are
now supported in the regular expression language.  A look-back
assertion tests a sub-pattern against the characters <i>preceding</i>
the current match point, which makes it possible to apply conditions
to the preceding context where a potential match appears.  TADS follows
the widely-used Perl-style syntax for the new assertions.

<li>In the past, the regular expression compiler explicitly ignored
any closure operator (*, +, {}) applied to an assertion, because such
constructs are essentially meaningless and are susceptible to infinite
loops.  The compiler no longer takes this approach; instead, it does a
thorough check for meaningless loops in the regular expression, and
deletes them.  This is an improvement because it detects all loops, no
matter how complex, whereas the old approach only caught this one
superficial case.  This change creates one behavior difference, which
is that it corrects the effect of the * operator applied to an
assertion: in the past, the * was simply ignored, whereas it now
correctly requires that the assertion is true zero or more times.
This is the same as removing the assertion entirely, since a condition
that has to be true zero or more times is really no condition at all.

<li>The new function <a
href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#sprintf">sprintf()</a> creates formatted text
from data values according to a format template string.  This is
similar to the sprintf() function in many C-like languages.  This
style of string formatting is sometimes more compact and convenient
than the alternatives.  sprintf() is also particularly useful for
formatting numbers, since it has several style options for integers
and floating-point values that are tedious to code by hand.

<li>The new String method <a href="sysman/string.htm#splice">splice()</a>
lets you delete a portion of a string, insert new text into a string,
or both at the same time.  splice(idx, del, ins) deletes <i>del</i>
characters starting at index <i>idx</i>, and then inserts the string
<i>ins</i> in their place.  The <i>ins</i> string is optional, so you
can omit it if you just want to delete a segment of the string.

<li>The String method substr() now accepts a negative value for the
length argument, which specifies a number of characters to discard
from the end of the string.

<li>The new String method <a href="sysman/string.htm#split">split()</a>
divides a string into substrings at a given delimiter, which can be
given as either a string or a RexPattern (regular expression pattern).
It can alternatively split a string into substrings of a fixed length.
This method comes in handy for surprisingly many simple string parsing jobs.

<li>The new List method <a href="sysman/list.htm#join">join()</a>
concatenates the elements of the list together into a string.
<a href="sysman/vector.htm">Vector</a> has this same new method.

<li>The new String method <a href="sysman/string.htm#specialsToHtml">
specialsToHtml()</a> converts special TADS characters (such as \n
and \b sequences) to standard HTML equivalents.  This is designed
specifically for the Web UI, to make it easier to port games between
the traditional console UI and the Web UI by providing support in
the Web UI for the traditional (pre-HTML) TADS formatting codes.

<li>Another new String method, <a
href="sysman/string.htm#specialsToText"> specialsToText()</a>, is
similar to specialsToHtml(), but converts the string to plain text.
Special TADS characters are converted to their plain text equivalents,
the basic HTML "&amp;" entities are converted to their character
equivalents, a few basic tags (&lt;BR&gt;, &lt;P&gt;, and a few
others) are converted to suitable plain-text equivalents, and most
other tags are stripped out.  This is designed for situations where
you need a plain-text rendering of the way a TADS string would look
as displayed on the regular output console.

<li>The new string methods <a href="sysman/string.htm#urlEncode">urlEncode()</a>
and <a href="sysman/string.htm#urlDecode">urlDecode()</a> simplify
encoding and decoding URL parameter strings, for use in HTTP network
requests.  urlEncode() converts special characters to "%" encodings;
urlDecode() reverses the effect, translating "%" encodings back to
the character equivalents.

<li>Two new String methods, <a href="sysman/string.htm#sha256">sha256()</a>
and <a href="sysman/string.htm#digestMD5">digestMD5()</a>, calculate
standard hash values for the string's contents.  sha256() calculates
the 256-bit SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) hash, and digestMD5()
calculates the MD5 message digest.  The same methods are available on
ByteArray to hash the byte array's contents, and on File to hash
bytes from the file.

<li>It's now easier to convert between strings and ByteArray objects.
First, a ByteArray can now be converted to a string via toString(), or
via implicit conversions, such as a "&lt;&lt &gt;&gt;" embedding in a
string.  The bytes in the array are simply treated as Unicode
character codes.  Second, ByteArray.mapToString() can now be called
without a character set argument, or with nil for the character set;
this performs the same conversion as toString().  Third, the ByteArray
constructor has two new formats: <tt>new ByteArray('string')</tt>
creates an array containing the string, treating each character as a
Latin-1 character; and <tt>new ByteArray('string',
<i>charmap</i>)</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>'string'.mapToByteArray(<i>charmap</i>)</tt>, but is a little more
intuitive syntactically.  Similarly, String.mapToByteArray() can now
be called without the character mapper argument, which is equivalent
to <tt>new ByteArray('string')</tt>.

<li>ByteArray.mapToString(), the ByteArray constructor, and
String.mapToByteArray() now accept a string giving the name of a
character set in place of a CharacterSet object.  The methods simply
create a CharacterSet object for the given name automatically.  This
is more convenient for one-off conversions, but if you're using a
character set repeatedly keep in mind that it's more efficient for you
to create the object once and reuse it.

<li>Concatenating nil to a string with the "+" operator now simply
yields the original string.  That is, nil is treated as equivalent to
an empty string for this operator.  In the past, the literal string
"nil" was appended instead.  This was almost never useful, whereas
it's often a convenience to have nil treated as an empty string in
this situation.

<li>The compiler now recognizes the "\r" escape code in string
literals.  \r represents a Carriage Return character, ASCII 13, which
is the same meaning this code has in C, C++, Java, and Javascript.  \r
wasn't part of the TADS escape set historically (although you could
always code it numerically as \015 or \u000D), mostly because there
was never much need for it in practice.  TADS tries to smooth out
newline differences among platforms by representing all newline
sequences as \n characters, so it's rare for a \r to find its way into
a TADS string in the first place.  We've added \r mostly for the sake
of completeness and familiarity for C/Java programmers.

<li>The built-in function makeString() now returns an empty string if
the repeat count argument is zero, and throws an error if the count is
less than zero.  In the past, all repeat counts less than 1 were
treated as though 1 were specified.

<li>The new List method <a href="sysman/list.htm#splice">splice()</a>
lets you delete a portion of a List, insert new elements into the
list, or both at the same time.  splice(idx, del, ins1, ins2, ...)
deletes <i>del</i> elements of the list starting at index <i>idx</i>,
and then inserts the new elements <i>ins1</i>, <i>ins2</i>, etc., in
their place.  The new elements are optional; if they're omitted, the
method only does the deletion.  If <i>del</i> is 0, the method only
does the insertion.  The equivalent method is also now available
for <a href="sysman/vector.htm#splice">Vector</a>.

<li>The new static List method <a
href="sysman/list.htm#generate">generate()</a> creates a list with a
given number of elements by invoking a callback function to generate
each element's value.  This is similar to mapAll(), but rather than
transforming an existing list, generate() constructs a new list from a
formula.  For example, for a list of the first ten even integers, we
can write <tt>List.generate({i: i*2}, 10)</tt>.

<p>Vector.generate() works the same way to generate a new Vector.

<li>The Vector constructor now allows you to omit the initial
allocation argument in most cases.  You can call <tt>new Vector()</tt>
without any arguments to use a default initial allocation (currently
10 elements).  <tt>new Vector(<i>source</i>)</tt>, where <i>source</i>
is a list or another Vector, creates a Vector copy of the source
object using the source object's length as the initial allocation
size.  (This change is meant to make the Vector programming interface
more consistent with the spirit of the class as a high-level,
automatic collection manager.  The old requirement to specify what
amounts to an optimization parameter for every Vector was rather out
of character with this spirit.)

<li>Most of the List and Vector methods that take an index value
arguments now accept negative index values to count backwards from the
last element: -1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so
on.  For methods that insert elements, 0 generally counts as one past
the last element, to insert after the last existing element.  See the
individual List and Vector method descriptions for details.  Note that
this works only with method calls, not with the <tt>[ ]</tt> subscript
operator.

<li>The built-in functions max() and min() now accept a single list,
vector, or other list-like object value as the argument.  The result
is the highest or lowest value in the list.

<li>List has four new methods for finding minimum and maximum
elements, optionally applying a mapping function to the element values
to be minimized or maximized.  indexOfMin() returns the index of the
element with the minimum value; minVal() returns the minimum element
value; indexOfMax() returns the index of the element with the maximum
value; maxVal() returns the maximum element value.  With no
arguments, these methods all simply compare the element values
directly, and minVal() and maxVal() return the lowest/highest
element value.  These methods can all optionally take one argument
giving a function pointer.  If the function argument is supplied, the
methods call the function for each element in the list, passing the
element's value as the argument to the callback function, and the
methods all use the return value of the function in place of the
element value.  For example, if lst is a list of string values,
lst.maxVal({x: x.length()}) returns the length of the longest string
in the list.

<p>Vector has the same four new methods.

<li>The File object has a new pair of methods, packBytes() and
unpackBytes(), that make it much easier to work with raw binary files,
especially files in third-party or standard formats such as JPEG or
MP3.  The new methods convert between bytes in a file and TADS
datatypes in your program, using a mini-language that can express
complex data structures very compactly.  This is based on the similar
facility in Perl and php, so if you're familiar with one of those
you'll already know the basics.  ByteArray and String have their own
versions of the methods as well, for times when you want to prepare
byte structures in memory rather than in a file.  For details, see <a
href="sysman/pack.htm">Byte Packing</a> in the System Manual.

<li>A new static (class-level) File method, File.getRootName(),
extracts the "root" portion of a filename string.  This is the portion
of the filename that excludes any directory or folder path prefix.
For example, given a string 'a/b/c.txt' while running on a Unix
machine, the function returns 'c.txt'.  The function uses the correct
local naming rules for the OS that the program is actually running on.

<li>In File.openTextFile() and File.openTextResource(), if the
character set isn't specified (because the parameter is missing or
nil), the default is now the system's default local character set for
file contents.  This is the same character that
getLocalCharSet(CharsetFileCont) returns.  In the past, the default
was always "us-ascii".  Another small enhancement is that the
character set parameter can now be given as nil, which explicitly
selects the default (in the past, if you wanted the default, you had
to omit the parameter entirely).

<li>A new static (class-level) File method, File.deleteFile(), lets
you delete files.  The file safety level for write mode applies to
deletions, so you can only delete a file that you could also
overwrite.

<li>File.writeBytes() now accepts a File object as the source of
the data to write to the file.  This makes it easy to copy a portion
of one file to another file.  When the source is a File object,
the <i>start</i> parameter specifies a seek location in the source
file; if <i>start</i> is omitted or nil, the default starting location
is the current seek location in the file.

<li>A new File method, setMode(), lets you change the data mode of an
open file.

<li>In the past, File.getPos() wasn't reliable when reading from text
files.  The File object internally buffers text read from the file so
that it can perform character set conversions, and getPos() was
incorrectly returning the position of the last byte read into the
internal buffer, rather than the read position within the buffer.
This made it impossible to reliably seek back to a starting location
in the middle of a series of text reads.  This is now fixed.

<li>Reading from a file opened in one of the read/write access modes
(FileAccessReadWriteKeep, FileAccessReadWriteTrunc) didn't work in
past versions; it could cause a crash.  This has been corrected.

<li>The File methods that open resource files are now affected by the
file safety level.  If a resource isn't bundled into the .t3 file, the
open-resource methods traditionally looked for the resource as a
separate, unbundled file within the image file's folder.  They now do
this <b>only if</b> the file safety level would allow access to the
same file through a regular open-file method.  This makes it
especially important for you to explicitly bundle any resources
directly into the .t3 file, since bundled resources are always
accessible, regardless of file safety settings.

<li>The new intrinsic class <a
href="sysman/tempfile.htm">TemporaryFile</a> provides support for
temporary files in the local file system.  A temporary file is a file
that only exists for the duration of the program's execution, and is
automatically deleted when the program exits.  You can manipulate
temporary files even when the file safety level prohibits access to
the local file system, because their inherent limitations prevent
misuse by malicious programs.

<p>Use <tt>new TemporaryFile()</tt> to create a TemporaryFile object.
The system automatically assigns the new object a unique filename in
the local file system, typically in a special system directory
designated by the operating system.  You don't specify the name of a
temporary file, since the system chooses the name for you to ensure
uniqueness.  Creating the TemporaryFile object doesn't actually create
a file on disk; it merely generates a filename that you can use.  You
can then create, read, write, and otherwise manipulate the actual file
using the File object.  Pass the TemporaryFile object in place of the
filename string to open the file.  You can also use TemporaryFile
objects in most other system functions that operate on files
(saveGame(), restoreGame(), setLogFile(), scriptScriptFile(), and
logConsoleCreate()).


<li>The file safety level is now separated into two components, one
for reading files and the other for writing files.  The safety levels
have the same meanings as in past versions, but you can now select the
read and write levels separately by specifying two digits in the
<tt>-s</tt> option.  The first digit is the read level, and the second
is the write level.  For example, <tt>-s04</tt> allows all read
access, but blocks all write access.  If you specify only one digit,
the given level is applied to both read and write operations, so
the option works the same way it used to if you use the old syntax.
The default is still <tt>-s2</tt>, which allows read and write access
to the directory containing the image file, and denies all other file
access.

<li>The file safety levels that restrict access to the image file
directory now consider files within subdirectories of that directory
to be within that directory.  In the past this was ambiguous, although
most systems considered only allowed access to files directly in the
image file directory.  It makes more sense to allow subdirectory
access than to forbid it: subdirectories are conceptually contained
within their parent directory, so access within subdirectories is
still effectively sandboxed to the containing directory.

<li>Saved game files can now include an optional "metadata" table,
containing game-defined descriptive information about the state of the
game at the time of creating the save file.  This can include any
information the game wishes to include, such as the current room
location, score, number of turns, chapter number, etc.  The
interpreter and other tools can extract this information and display
it to the user when browsing a collection of saved game files, to help
jog the user's memory about the game position saved in the file.  See
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#saveGame">saveGame()</a> in the System
Manual for details.

<li>The setLogFile() and setScriptFile() built-in functions now return
values, to indicate success or failure.  On success, the functions
return true; on failure, they return nil.  A failure result from
setLogFile() means that the specified file can't be created, and from
setScriptFile() it means the file doesn't exist or can't be opened.

<li>The new IntrinsicClass static method isIntrinsicClass() lets you
determine if a given object is an IntrinsicClass instance.  This isn't
possible using ofKind() or getSuperclassList(), because those methods
work within the <i>inheritance</i> class tree for the intrinsic types.
This new method is required to make this determination.
IntrinsicClass is only used for the <i>representation</i> of an
intrinsic class, and isn't involved in the inheritance structure.
For more information, see the <a href="sysman/icic.htm">IntrinsicClass</a>
documentation.

<li>You can now enter expressions containing anonymous functions
interactively in the debugger (such as in the "Watch" list, breakpoint
conditions, or the expression evaluation dialog).  This wasn't
allowed in the past.

<li>The debugger now shows the contents of a Vector in-line when you
inspect its value, just like a list.  This saves you the trouble of
using the "+" box in the watch window every time you want to look at a
small vector's contents.  You can still use the "+" box as usual, but
when a vector only has a few elements, the in-line display is usually
all you'll need.

<li>The debugger now makes it easy to view the contents of a
LookupTable.  First, when a LookupTable value is displayed in a
tooltip or in a watch window, the list of keys and values is displayed
using the new <tt>[key-&gt;value]</tt> list notation.  Second, when
inspecting a lookup table object in a watch window, you can now click
the "+" symbol to inspect the list of key/value pairs stored in the
table.

<li>The debugger now shows the original pattern string in-line
when inspecting a variable containing a RexPattern object.

<li>When rand() is used with multiple arguments, it now only evaluates
the one randomly chosen argument value.  This means that side effects
will only be triggered for the chosen argument, and not for any of the
other arguments.  This is useful because it means that you can use
rand() to intentionally trigger a randomly selected side effect.
For example: <tt>rand("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")</tt> prints
out a randomly selected number from one to five, and
<tt>rand(f(x), g(x), h(x))</tt> randomly calls one of the functions
f(), g(), or h().

<li>The rand() function can now generate a random string based on a
template string.  When rand() is called with a single string argument,
the function returns a string of random characters chosen according to
the template.  See the <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#rand">rand()</a>
documentation for details.

<li>The interpreter now automatically seeds the random number
generator at the start of the run.  In the past, it was up to the
program to do this by explicitly calling the randomize() function.
The reason for changing the default is that defaults in general should
be the settings most people would want most of the time, and in this
case that's clearly automatic randomizing.  The only time you'd want
<i>not</i> to randomize is during regression testing, when you want to
verify that the program runs exactly the same way every time.  When
you do want a repeatable random number sequence, specify the new
<tt>-norand</tt> interpreter option: <tt>t3run -norand mygame.t3</tt>

<li>A new BigNumber method, numType(), returns information on the type
of value represented by the BigNumber.  This allows you to identify
the special distinguished values "Not a Number" (NaN) and positive and
negative infinity.

<li>A few new BigNumber.formatString() flags have been added:
BignumCompact (use the more compact of the regular format or
scientific notation); BignumMaxSigDigits (count only significant
digits against the maxDigits limit, not leading zeros);
BignumKeepTrailingZeros (keep trailing zeros after the decimal point
to fill out the result to maxDigits in length).

<li>toString() now respects the radix argument for BigNumber values
that are whole integers.

<li>toString() accepts a new "isSigned" argument that lets you control
whether a signed or unsigned interpretation should be used for integer
values.  In the past, this was tied to radix - decimal treated values
as signed, any other radix as unsigned.  The default is the same
as before, but you can now override it to get an unsigned decimal
representation, or a signed hex representation, for example.

<li>toInteger() now accepts any radix from 2 to 36.  The letters A
through Z represent digit values 10 through 35 for bases above 10, in
analogy to hexadecimal notation.  For better consistency with its
name, the function also now converts the strings "true" and "nil"
respectively to 1 and 0 (instead of the boolean true and nil values
that it formerly returned), and converts the boolean values true and
nil to 1 and 0.  It's also a little more liberal about parsing strings
containing the text "true" or "nil", in that it now ignores leading
and trailing spaces.

<li>The new function <a
href="sysman/tadsgen.htm#toNumber">toNumber()</a> is similar to
toInteger(), but also parses strings representing BigNumber values.
If the input is a string representing a floating point value (i.e., it
has a decimal point or uses the 'E' exponential format), or an
integer that's too large for an ordinary 32-bit TADS integer, the
value is returned as a BigNumber.  If it's a whole number that fits in
a 32-bit integer, it's returned as an integer.  This routine can also
be used to parse a BigNumber integer value in a non-decimal radix.

<li>The compiler now pays attention to resource file timestamps in
determining whether it needs to rebuild the image file.  In the past,
merely updating a resource file didn't trigger a relink, so the image
wouldn't be updated with a new resource until it was relinked for some
other reason.

<li>The new "if-nil" operator <a href="sysman/expr.htm#ifnil"><tt>??</tt></a>
checks an expression to
see if the value is nil, and if so yields a default value.
<tt>a ?? b</tt> yields <i>a</i> if <i>a</i> is not nil, otherwise
it yields <i>b</i>.  This is a concise and efficient (in terms
of code size and execution time) way to write a default value
substitution, which is a common situation when using argument
values from callers, property values set elsewhere in the code,
and function and method call results.

<li>The new operator <tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> performs a logical right
shift.  Furthermore, the existing <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> operator is now
explicitly defined as performing an arithmetic right shift.  In the
past, it wasn't specified whether <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> performed an
arithmetic or logical shift, although in practice all existing
implementations (as far as we know) performed an arithmetic shift, so
existing programs shouldn't see any change.

<p>The difference between the arithmetic and logical right shift is
the treatment of the vacated high-order bits.  A logical right shift
fills all vacated bits with zeros, whereas an arithmetic right shift
fills the vacated bits with the original high-order bit of the left
operand.  Arithmetic shifts are so named because copying the
high-order bit preserves the sign of the original value.

<p>The <tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> operator isn't purely a TADS invention.
Java and Javascript define it the same way TADS does, and likewise
specify that <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> performs an arithmetic shift.

<li>Many of the standard bundled character sets now recognize a number
of name variations, based on naming conventions used in various other
programming languages and applications.  They're meant to make the
character mapper a little easier to use by letting you use names that
you might be accustomed to using from other systems, rather than
having to remember a separate naming scheme for TADS.  The new
variations (which are all insensitive to upper/lower case) are:

<ul>
   <li>Latin-X: In the past, these had to be called "isoN",
   as in "iso2" for Latin-2.  The mapper now also accepts
   Latin2, Latin-2, ISO-2, 8859-2, ISO8859-2, ISO-8859-2, ISO_8859-2,
   ISO_8859_2, and L2.  (Likewise for Latin-3, Latin-4, etc.)

   <li>Windows and DOS code pages: The old name was "cpXXX", where
   XXX is the code page number, as in "cp1252".  The mapper now also
   accepts just plain 1252, as well as win1252, win-1252, windows1252,
   windows-1252, dos1252, and dos-1252.

   <li>UCS-2LE: The little-endian 16-bit Unicode character sets can also
   be called UCS2LE, UTF-16LE, UTF16LE, UTF_16LE, UnicodeL, Unicode-L,
   and Unicode-LE. 

   <li>UCS-2BE:  The big-endian 16-bit Unicode character sets can also
   be called UCS2BE, UTF-16BE, UTF16BE, UTF_16BE, UnicodeB, Unicode-B,
   and Unicode-BE. 
</ul>

<li>BigNumber now uses the standard "round to nearest, ties to even"
rule whenever rounding occurs, including calculation results and
explicit rounding requests.  This is the rounding method that most
computer floating point systems use, because it's considered the least
statistically biased.

<p>The new rule is to round to the nearest digit, or to round to the
nearest <i>even</i> digit when exactly halfway between two digits.
For example, rounding 104.5 to integer yields 104: the value is
exactly halfway between 104 and 105, so we round to the nearest even
digit for a result of 104.  Similarly, rounding 1.2345 to four digits
yields 1.234, since 1.2345 is exactly halfway between 1.234 and 1.235,
and the nearest even digit in last place is 4.

<p>The <b>old</b> algorithm was <i>almost</i> identical: it was "round
to nearest, ties away from zero", which rounded to the next higher
absolute value when exactly halfway between digits.  For example,
rounding 104.5 to integer formerly yielded 105, since we formerly
always rounded up from the halfway point.  There's no change for
values that aren't exactly halfway between digits: rounding 102.5001
or 103.4999 to integer both yield 103 under both the new and old
rules.

<li>The console output formatter now renders embedded null characters
(Unicode value U+0000) as spaces.  In the past, the formatter
considered a null to be the end of a string, which isn't consistent
with TADS string semantics.

<li>The compiler is less conservative than it used to be about a
certain optimization involving anonymous functions.  In the past,
every anonymous function expression triggered the creation of an
AnonFuncPtr object.  This object contains the anonymous function's
context: the local variables and "self" from its enclosing code block.
However, many anonymous functions are entirely self-contained, meaning
they don't make any reference to their enclosing contexts.  These
don't actually need a context object, since they have no dependency on
anything that would go in it.  There's a slight performance cost to
creating the context object, so the compiler now creates one only when
it's actually needed.

<p>This change should be <i>almost</i> invisible to game code.  It's
possible to detect if you're looking for it by checking the dataType()
of an anonymous function value: it was formerly always TypeObject, but
now it can also be TypeFuncPtr, for cases where no context object is
needed.  Other than this (and a slight speed improvement), the change
should be transparent.

<li>It's now possible to break out of an infinite loop if you should
happen to get stuck in one evaluating an expression within the
debugger.  The debugger already let you break into normal program
execution that was stuck looping, using a platform-defined keystroke
or other UI action (on Windows, for example, the Workbench debugger
uses the key combination Ctrl+Break).  The same thing now works if you
evaluate a debugger expression that gets stuck in a loop.  (In the
past, the debugger ignored the "break" command while it already had
control.  It now interrupts the expression by throwing an error.)

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000093">bugdb.tads.org #0000093</a>)

<li>In past versions, the StringComparator object didn't save its list
of character equivalence mappings properly to the image file or to
saved game files.  This caused character mappings to be lost
(corrupted, actually, but for practical purposes lost) when they were
made during preinit, or when restoring a game where a StringComparator
with mappings had been created dynamically.  This has been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000085">bugdb.tads.org #0000085</a>)


<li>The multi-method inherited() operator didn't work properly if used
within a function that was replaced by another function using the
"modify" statement.  This is now fixed.

<li>A bug in the compiler sometimes caused a crash in a rare situation
involving a link-time symbol conflict (in particular, the same symbol
defined as a <tt>grammar</tt> rule in one module and a different type
in another module).  This has been corrected.

<li>A bug in the regular expression search functions prevented
matching zero-length expressions at the end of the subject string.
For example, searching for <tt>'x*$'</tt> correctly matched 'uvwx'
(with a match length of 1), but not 'uvw' (which <i>should</i> match
with a length of 0).  This has been fixed.

<li>A regular expression bug caused incorrect results to be returned
for capturing groups for certain complex expression types.  This
was triggered by an expression with two wildcard closures preceding
a capturing group preceding some fixed text.  This is now fixed.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000088">bugdb.tads.org #0000088</a>)

<li>In past versions of the text-only interpreters, if an
&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt; section contained an &lt;IMG&gt; tag with an ALT
attribute, the ALT text was displayed.  It shouldn't have been,
because the text-only systems aren't supposed to display
<i>anything</i> that's within an &lt;ABOUTBOX&gt; section.  This has
been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000063">bugdb.tads.org #0000063</a>)

<li>The text-only interpreters now parse and translate HTML
entity markups ("&amp" sequences) within &lt;TITLE&gt; tags when
setting the window title.  (In past versions, the text-only
interpreters simply displayed the literal text of the &amp;
sequences.  The HTML interpreters didn't have this problem,
so this change doesn't affect them.)

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000062">bugdb.tads.org #0000062</a>)

<li>The bug fix in 3.0.18 for newline translation in UTF-16 text files
introduced another bug, which corrupted output text when calling
writeFile() with a string containing embedded newline ('\n') characters.
This has been corrected.

(<a href="http://bugdb.tads.org/view.php?id=0000065">bugdb.tads.org #0000065</a>)

<li><a name="compoundAsiSideEffects"></a>The compiler formerly
generated code that was arguably incorrect for a compound assignment
expression containing side effects in the lvalue.  In the past,
the compiler effectively expanded an expression of the form
<i>lvalue op= rvalue</i> into <i>lvalue = lvalue op rvalue</i>.  For
example, "a += b" became "a = a + b".  In most cases this is fine, but
when the lvalue contains side effects, it results in two evaluations
of the side effects.  For example, "lst[i++] += 1" incremented "i"
twice.  For a really complex expression like "lst[i++][j++][k++] +=
2", the "i++" side effect was triggered even more times, because
it contains multiple implied lvalues.

<p>The correct behavior is to evaluate each subexpression in the
lvalue only once.  The compiler now generates code that does just this.

<p>The old behavior was only <i>arguably</i> wrong, in that the
correct behavior wasn't really specified anywhere.  But to the extent
that TADS doesn't fully specify its expression behavior,
it's reasonable to expect
that TADS should behave like C++.  C++ does have well-defined
semantics for this situation, which the new behavior matches.
Plus, the new behavior is in line
with the obvious reading of an <i>op</i>= expression: the lvalue is
only mentioned once in such an expression, suggesting that it should
only be evaluated once.

<li>A bug in the debugger caused a crash under rare circumstances.
The problem happened when a run-time error occurred within a callback
function being invoked from certain built-in functions or methods, and
you then terminated the program via the debugger UI while execution
was still suspended at the error location.  This is now fixed.

<li>A bug in the Vector intrinsic class caused rare, random crashes
under certain conditions when calling mapAll().  The crashes were most
likely with very large vectors, and only when the callback function
could trigger garbage collection (such as by creating a new object).
This has been fixed.

<li>A bug in the BigNumber class caused inaccurate results for expE(),
raiseToPower(), sinh(), cosh(), and tanh() for certain values.  The
problem only affected a limited (but difficult to characterize) range
of input values.  For affected values, the results were still correct
to about 17 decimal places; the inaccuracy appeared starting at about
the 18th decimal place, so it would only have been noticeable in
applications requiring relatively high precisions.  For example, a
program that would have been happy with the standard C "double" type
wouldn't have noticed the bug, because the typical C double provides
only about 15 decimal digits of precision.  The problem is now fixed.

<li>In past versions, the ByteArray object didn't save undo
information for File.readBytes() or ByteArray.writeInt() operations.
It now saves the undo.

<li class=last>The compiler incorrectly reported internal errors for assignments
to objects, functions, and other global symbol names.  The compiler now
shows a regular error message instead for this type of error.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.18.1 (May 5, 2009)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The behavior of the multi-method inherited() operator has changed.
The operator now chooses the inherited function to call based on the
actual argument values, rather than the formal (declared) parameters
to the current function.  This is more consistent with the inherited()
operator for regular methods.

<li class=last>A bug in the compiler, versions 3.0.17, 3.0.17.1, and 3.0.18,
caused incorrect (too small) stack size requests to be generated for
some functions and methods.  This generally had no noticeable effect
on valid programs, but it made it possible for an errant program (with
infinite recursion, for example) to cause a stack overflow that the
interpreter doesn't detect immediately, which could conceivably crash
the interpreter.  An actual crash would require an unlikely
combination of factors, even with an errant program compiled with this
bug, so you'll probably never notice it.  Even so, if you distributed
any .t3 files compiled with t3make versions 3.0.17 through 3.0.18, we
recommend recompiling with the current t3make version and replacing
your previously distributed files, if it's easy for you to do so.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.18 (April 28, 2009)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <tt>inherited</tt> operator can now be used within a multi-method
to inherit an overridden version of the method.  The new syntax
<tt>inherited&lt;<i>type-list</i>&gt;(<i>arg-list</i>)</tt> lets you
inherit a specific version of the multi-method, while the basic syntax
<tt>inherited(<i>arg-list</i>)</tt> automatically selects the next
more general version of the multi-method.  See the System Manual
section on multi-methods for documentation.

<li>The compiler pre-defines the new preprocessor symbol (i.e., macro)
__TADS3, which expands simply to the number 1.  This provides an easy
way to detect that the compiler is a TADS 3 compiler (as opposed to a
TADS 2 compiler) for conditional compilation purposes.  (This might
seem redundant with the existing symbol __TADS_SYSTEM_MAJOR, but
__TADS3 can be used in one way that __TADS_SYSTEM_MAJOR can't.  If for
some reason you wanted to create a single source file that could be
compiled under TADS 2 or TADS 3, using conditional compilation to
handle the syntax differences between the language versions, you
couldn't do it with __TADS_SYSTEM_MAJOR.  This is because TADS 2
doesn't support #if, which is the only way you could use
__TADS_SYSTEM_MAJOR to conditionally compile based on compiler version
(e.g., <tt>#if __TADS_SYSTEM_MAJOR == 3</tt>).  Since TADS 2 and 3
both support #ifdef, though, you can use the presence or absence of
the __TADS3 symbol to conditionally include or omit code based on
language version.  Of course, since older versions of the TADS 3
compiler also lack this symbol, this approach requires using 3.0.17.2
or later on the TADS 3 side.)

<li>In past versions, writing to text files with a UTF-16 encoding
generated incorrect newline sequences when running on Windows.  The
problem had to do with the two-character representation of a newline
in Windows.  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>In the past, multi-methods defined in one source file and called
from another resulted in an "undefined symbol" error.  This has been
corrected.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.17.1 (8/12/2008)</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last><p>A compiler bug introduced in 3.0.17 caused Workbench (and the
stand-alone interpreter) to crash when loading certain games when
compiled for debugging.  The compiler was mis-calculating some
internal data structure sizes, which effectively corrupted the .t3
file; this happened when the byte code for a function plus its debug
symbols was over a certain threshold size.  This has been corrected.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.17 (8/9/2008)</h3>

<ul>

<li><p>The compiler has a new feature called "multi-methods."  This
implements a relatively new object-oriented programming technique
known as multiple dispatch, in which the types of <i>multiple</i>
arguments can be used to determine which of several possible functions
to call.  The traditional TADS method call uses a
<i>single-dispatch</i> system: when you write "x.foo(3)", you're
invoking the method foo as defined on the object x, or as inherited
from the nearest superclass of x that defines that method.  This is
known as single dispatch because a single value (x) controls the
selection of which definition of foo will be invoked.  With multiple
dispatch, this notion is extended so that multiple values can be
considered when selecting which method to invoke.  For example, you
could write one version of a function "putIn()" that operates on a
Thing and a Container, and another version of the same function that
operates on a Liquid and a Vessel, and the system will automatically
choose the correct version at run-time based on the types of
<i>both</i> arguments.  This new system is described more fully
in the <i>System Manual</i>.
</p>

<li><p>The compiler can now generate information in each object about the
source file where the object was defined.  This new information is
stored in a new property, sourceTextGroup; this supplements the
existing sourceTextOrder property.  Since the new information takes up
extra space in the compiled file, it's not generated by default.  To
generate it, include the new compiler option "-Gstg" in your makefile
or command line, <i>or</i> place the directive <tt>#pragma
sourceTextGroup(on)</tt> directive in each source module where you
wish to generate the information.  The #pragma lets you selectively
generate the information in specific source files, or even in specific
portions of specific source files: the corresponding directive
<tt>#pragma sourceTextGroup(off)</tt> lets you turn off the
information in a section where you don't need it.</p>

<p>When you turn on sourceTextGroup generation, the compiler
automatically adds a sourceTextGroup property to each object, just as
it automatically adds a sourceTextOrder value.  The sourceTextGroup
value is a reference to an anonymous object that the compiler
automatically creates.  One such object is generated per source module
for which sourceTextGroup generation is activated.  This object
contains two properties: sourceTextGroupName is a string giving the
name of the module, as it appeared in the compiler command line,
makefile (.t3m), or library (.tl) file; sourceTextGroupOrder is an
integer giving the relative order of the module among the list of
modules comprising the overall program.
</p>

<p>sourceTextGroup is useful in cases where you want to establish the
order of appearance in source files among objects in multiple modules.
For a given object <tt>x</tt>,
<tt>x.sourceTextGroup.sourceTextGroupOrder</tt> gives you the relative
order within the overall build of the module where <tt>x</tt> was
defined, and <tt>x.sourceTextOrder</tt> gives you the relative order
of <tt>x</tt> among the objects defined within that module.  Between
the two values, you can establish a linear ordering for all of the
statically defined objects in the entire program.</p>

<li><p>The compiler now stores "links" to resource files in the .t3 file
when compiling in Debug mode.  This makes it easier to test a game
that uses multimedia resources, by making the Build environment match
the Release environment more precisely.</p>

<p>In the past, when building in Debug
mode, the compiler completely ignored multimedia resource files listed
in the "-res" section of the command line or makefile.  This was by
design; the reasoning was that when you're compiling in Debug mode,
you'll only be running that copy on your development machine, within
your build environment, where all of the resource files are available
as local files; and since the files are all available as separate
local files anyway, we can make the compilation go faster by skipping
the step where we copy those files into the .t3 file.</p>

<p>This worked
fine <i>most</i> of the time, but it didn't work in the occasional
case where the resource name is different from the corresponding local
file's name in the file system.  One example is the Cover Art file,
which is always stored in the game under the resource name
".system/CoverArt.jpg", which is usually <i>not</i> the same name the
file has locally.  This meant that if you tried to refer to such a
resource via HTML (such as with an &lt;IMG&gt; tag), the resource was
reported as missing when running the debug build.</p>

<p>The new arrangement
fixes this problem without giving up the time savings.  With the new
scheme, the compiler stores a <b>link</b> for each resource in the .t3
file: this simply records the mapping from resource name to local
file name.  The HTML renderer can then look up the appropriate local
file for each resource, including any resources that have special
names.  As before, the actual contents of the resources are not
copied.
</p>

<p>Note that none of this affects Release builds.  The compiler has
always copied the full contents of all resources into the .t3 file
when doing a Release build, and continues to do so.  Release builds
continue to be fully self-contained, so that you only have to
distribute the .t3 file to players, <i>not</i> the individual
graphics and sound files it refers to.</p>

<li class=last><p>The compiler's status output didn't add a line break after each
resource files being added to the project, resulting in poorly formatted
displays.  This has been corrected.</p>

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.16 (4/10/2008)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The Author's Kit installer now gives you an option to skip
creating the Windows file type associations for Workbench
(specifically, project (.t3m) files).

<li>The main startup routine in the library now performs an explicit
garbage collection pass just before performing pre-initialization.  In
most cases, this is unnecessary (and harmless, obviously, apart from
the added execution time required to perform the GC pass).  However,
under a certain combination of conditions, it can be important.  In
particular, it's important when a program is compiled so that preinit
is performed at run-time rather than compile-time (this is normally
the case for a "debug mode" build, but can be explicitly selected for
a release build as well), <i>and</i> the program has
pre-initialization code that performs global object loops.  In such a
program, a RESTART would re-run preinit, which could then encounter
garbage objects still around from before the RESTART.  The explicit GC
pass just before preinit ensures that preinit sees only reachable
objects in any global object loops it performs.

<li>A bug in the ByteArray intrinsic class caused an interpreter crash
when copying exactly the full bounds of an array onto itself.  This has
been corrected.

<li>The rexReplace() intrinsic function got stuck in an infinite loop
when the pattern to be replaced matched zero characters of the subject
string.  For example, a match pattern of "x*" is able to match any
number of "x" characters in a row, <i>including</i> zero of them.  The
problem was that the function simply spun its wheels, repeatedly
finding the same zero-character match and replacing it over and over.
This no longer occurs: the function will apply each zero-character
replacement once only, and then move on to the next character of the
subject string before attempting a new match.

<li>The rexSearch() and rexReplace() functions didn't properly take
into account "^" (start-of-string) pattern specifiers when a starting
offset for the search was explicitly specified.  The functions
incorrectly considered "^" to match the start of the substring
starting at the given starting offset, whereas it should have only
matched the start of the entire string.  In other words, "^" should
never match when the starting offset is greater than 1.  This has been
corrected.

<li>A bug in the t3DebugTrace() intrinsic function sometimes caused the
debugger to stop execution at the second line after the t3DebugTrace()
function, rather than at the next line.  This happened if you used the
"Go" command to resume execution from the point where t3DebugTrace()
stopped, then encountered the same t3DebugTrace() call without any
intervening debugger activity.  This has been corrected.

<li>Comparing another object value to "self" in a global breakpoint
expression sometimes caused the debugger to crash in past versions.
This has been corrected.

<li>In the past, the compiler returned a "success" indication to the
operating system shell as long as no error messages were displayed
during the compilation.  This was incorrect in cases where the "treat
warnings as errors" option was enabled and one or more warning
messages were displayed; in these cases, the compiler should have
returned a "failure" indication to reflect the fact that warnings
count as full-fledged errors under this option setting.  This has
been corrected.

<li class=last>Applying toInteger() to BigNumber values near the
capacity limits of the 32-bit integer type, but not exceeding them,
sometimes produced spurious "numeric overflow" errors.  In particular,
values over 2147483640 or under -2147483640 that needed to be rounded
up in their fractional parts (e.g., 2147483640.9) produced this
spurious error.  This has been corrected.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.15.3 (11/2/2007)</h3>

<ul>

<li>A bug in the compiler made it impossible to refer to items in
global scope (such as enum values or objects) in constant expressions
within anonymous functions.  For example, it was impossible to use
an enum value or object name as a 'case' label in a 'switch' statement
within an anonymous function.  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>A bug in the GrammarProd intrinsic class caused incorrect results
in some cases for an empty production (i.e., a grammar rule consisting
of no tokens).  The problem had to do with the way the empty
production figured its position in the input token list; since
enclosing levels in the match tree find their positions relative to
child nodes, the problem typically manifested itself by giving
incorrect token list positions for one or more match levels enclosing
an empty match.  This is now fixed.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.15.2 (9/13/2007)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The inputFile() function now makes some additional checks when the
filename is supplied by an active event script file.  If the dialog
type is InFileOpen, the function checks to make sure the filename read
from the script refers to an existing file.  If the dialog type is
InFileSave, and the named file doesn't already exist, the function
tries to create a dummy copy of the file; if that succeeds, the
function immediately deletes the dummy copy.  The function also still
tests, as it did before, to make sure the file <i>doesn't</i> already
exist for InFileSave dialogs.  If any of these tests fail, the
function warns the user about the problem and offers the same options
it did in the past for the save-overwrite case: use the filename as
given in the script, choose a different file, or cancel the script
playback.

<li class=last>A bug in the VM caused sporadic, unpredictable errors when
finalizers were used.  The problem affected one opcode (OPCGETPROPR0);
if a finalizer invocation happened to interrupt this particular
opcode, the result was unpredictable, but could include spurious
run-time errors or corruptions of calculated results.  This has been
corrected.

</ul>



<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.15.1 (7/19/2007)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The keyword <tt>replaced</tt> can now be used within anonymous
functions that are nested in modifier functions (i.e., functions
defined with <tt>modify <i>funcname</i> ...</tt>).  In the past, the
compiler only allowed <tt>replaced</tt> to be used <b>directly</b>
within a modifier function - not in nested anonymous functions defined
within a modifier function.  There's no inherent reason for
disallowing this construct; it was simply a limitation of the
compiler, which has now been lifted.

<li>In the system library, the several internal convenience macros
defined with the Tokenizer class (tokRuleName, tokRulePat,
tokRuleType, etc) have been moved from the tok.t class file to the
tok.h header file.  The macros are unchanged, so this change won't
affect existing code.  The macros were formerly defined in tok.t
rather than in the header because they were meant as private macros
for internal use within the Tokenizer class itself, not for client
code that uses the Tokenizer class.  However, they're also useful in
subclasses of Tokenizer, so it's desirable to have them defined in a
header - that way, user code implementing Tokenizer subclasses can
access the macros simply by #including tok.h.

<li>The compiler is now stricter about interpreting tokens as
BigNumber constants.  In the past, the compiler treated an "E"
following a numeric constant as an exponent signifier, even if no
digits followed.  For example, "3E-a" was taken to be the BigNumber
constant "3E-0", followed by a separate token "a".  The compiler now
treats an "E" as the start of a separate token if no digits follow it
(or the optional + or - sign after the "E"), so "3E-a" would now be
treated as four tokens: "3", "E", "-", and "a".

<li>The compiler now displays a specific error if it finds a decimal
digit within an octal constant value.  In the past, the compiler
simply assumed that a decimal digit terminated the octal constant
token and started a new token.  This typically led to a confusing
parsing error, since the compiler saw two consecutive numeric constant
tokens where the user almost always intended one.  The compiler now
flags a specific error about the ill-formed octal value, and skips any
decimal digits following the octal constant, which makes the error
much easier to pinpoint.

<li>The compiler is now strict about disallowing the old TADS 2
"&lt;&gt;" (unequal-to) operator.  This variation was not documented,
but has up to now been allowed.

<li class=last>The compiler no longer treats <tt>delete</tt> as a reserved word.
(It did so in the past as a hold-over from TADS 2, where
<tt>delete</tt> is indeed reserved.)

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.15 (3/8/2007)</h3>

<ul>

<li>When an input event script is being played back, the inputFile()
function now prompts the user if the result would likely overwrite an
existing file.  inputFile() in this case prompts the user
interactively, momentarily halting script playback until the user
responds.  This is described more fully in the Input Scripts section
of the System Manual.

<li class=last>The compiler reported an internal error ("too much unsplicing") in
certain complex expressions involving multi-line string literals as
macro arguments in embedded &lt&lt; &gt;&gt; expressions.  This has
been corrected.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.14 (2/9/2007)</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last>The raiseToPower() method of the BigNumber class incorrectly
returned 1 as the result of raising 0 to a non-zero exponent.  The
correct result should, of course, be 0 for any positive exponent, and
an exception for any non-positive exponent (as 0^0 is undefined, and
0^n with n&lt;0 is effectively division by zero).  The method now
yields these results.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.13 (1/19/2007)</h3>

<ul>

<li>A new t3make option, -we, tells the compiler to treat warnings as
though they were errors, for the purposes of determining whether or
not to proceed with compilation after a warning occurs.  When the
compiler finds an error within a source file, it stops the build
process after finishing with that compilation unit, requiring you to
fix the error before continuing.  In contrast, warnings do not, by
default, interrupt the build.  This is because a warning message
indicates a situation that's <i>technically</i> correct, but which
contains a common pitfall.  Compiler warnings tend to be right often
enough to warrant close inspection, so many programmers adhere to the
discipline of insisting on "clean" builds every time - that is, with
no warning messages.  The -we option is a convenient way of enforcing
that discipline.  When you specify the -we option, the compiler will
stop the build after finishing with any module that generates any
warning messages, just as it does for error messages.  If you want
to explicitly set the default mode, where warnings do not interrupt
the build, use the -we- option.

<li>A new interpreter (t3run) option, -I, runs a command script in
"echo" mode.  This works almost the same as the existing -i option,
but -I causes all output to be displayed to the console as the script
is read; in contrast, -i reads the script in "quiet" mode, meaning
that no output is displayed while the script is running.

<li>The command script recorder and player can now handle virtually
any input event type, not just command lines.  The script mechanism
can now handle keyboard input, hyperlinks, ad hoc dialogs, and file
dialogs; the functions inputKey(), inputEvent(), inputFile(), and
inputDialog() can now take their input from a script.  (inputLine()
and inputLineTimeout() have always been able to read from scripts.)
To handle the greater range of event types, a new script file format
has been added; files written in new format are called Event Scripts.
Event scripts are identified by a special signature: the first line of
the file must read <tt>&lt;eventscript&gt;</tt>, with nothing else on
the line (not even spaces).  If a script doesn't start with this
signature, the script reader will interpret it as the original script
format, which is now called the Command-line Script.  This allows old
scripts to work without changes; of course, Command-line Scripts can
only contain line input events, as they always have.  When you create
a script with RECORD or the with the Interpreter's -o option, the
script is now recorded in the new Event Script format, and the
recorder will automatically include all event types in the script.
(There's no option with RECORD or -o to record an old-style
Command-line Script instead - there wouldn't seem to be much call for
this, as the functionality in Event Scripts is a superset of that of
Command-line Scripts.)  The new scripting functionality is described
in the "Input Scripts" chapter of the System Manual.

<li>The setScriptFile() intrinsic function now accepts a new type
code, LogTypeEvent.  This type signifies that a new-style Event Script
should be created.  The code LogTypeCommand, which was present in
previous versions, continues to signify that an old-style Command-line
Script should be created.

<li>Input scripts now nest during playback.  In the past, reading from
a new input script terminated reading from any input script already in
effect.  Now, the console suspends the original script, and resumes
reading from it upon reaching the end of the new script.  Scripts can
be nested to any depth.  This allows an input script to "include"
another by using, for example, the REPLAY command within the script.

<li>In the past, the getFuncParams() intrinsic function didn't accept
an anonymous function as its argument.  Anonymous functions are now
accepted.

<li>The inputLine() intrinsic function (in the 'tads-io' function set)
didn't correctly map non-ASCII characters (such as accented letters)
from the user's input to Unicode.  This has been corrected.

<li>A compiler bug caused a crash if a "modify" or "replace" statement
in one source module referred to a symbol that was actually defined in
a source module that was included in the build after the first source
file.  This is an error condition anyway - a symbol has to be defined
in the build before it can be modified or replaced, so the original
definition has to occur in a source module listed earlier than the
modifying module.  However, the compiler now handles such an error
properly, by displaying the appropriate error message and halting the
build.

<li>A bug in File.writeBytes() caused unpredictable results, sometimes
including an interpreter crash, if a zero or negative value was passed
for the starting index.  The starting index is now checked for range.

<li class=last>Some internal changes to the portable VM and compiler code have
been made to improve portability to 64-bit architectures.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.12 (9/15/2006)</h3>

<p><b>This is the TADS 3.0 General Release version.</b>

<ul>

<li class=last>A couple of compiler error messages were internally mis-numbered,
which could have caused the compiler to report the wrong error message
for the affected error codes.  These have been corrected.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.11 (9/8/2006)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The % operator now accepts only integer operands.  (In the past,
it failed to throw an error if a BigNumber operand was used, and
instead produced a meaningless result.)

<li>A comparison of the form "a==b", where a is an integer value and b
is a BigNumber value, now coerces the integer to a BigNumber before
comparing it.  In the past, this type of comparison coerced the
integer to a BigNumber only when the BigNumber was the left-hand
operand.  This correction ensures that "a==b" and "b==a" yield the
same results when comparing integers and BigNumber values.  The same
change applies to the != operator.

<li>In the past, the compiler reserved the names <tt>void</tt>,
<tt>int</tt>, <tt>string</tt>, <tt>list</tt>, <tt>boolean</tt>, and
<tt>any</tt>.  These names are no longer reserved and thus can now be
used freely as symbol names (for local variables, object names, etc).
(These names were originally reserved in anticipation of the eventual
introduction of optional static type declarations.  Reserving the
keywords ensured that no one would write code that would be
incompatible if the feature had ever been added.  The static typing
feature will definitely not appear in the official 3.0 release, and at
this point it seems very unlikely to be in any future version, so
there's no longer any good reason to reserve these names.)

<li class=last>A compiler bug caused invalid code to be generated in the following
situation:

<p><pre>
   x: object
     m(p) { }
     n = (p)  // bad code generated here
     p = nil
   ;
</pre>

<p>The bad code resulted from the compiler mistakenly using the local
symbol table from the method m(p) while generating the code for n; so
the compiler incorrectly treated p as a parameter variable in n, even
though n has no parameters.  This has been corrected.

<p>The local-to-Unicode character set mapper now converts any
unmappable character found in a source string to Unicode U+FFFD, the
standard Unicode "replacement character."  In the past, the mapper
converted unmappable characters to question marks, "?".  Converting to
question marks was undesirable because of the ambiguity it created.
When compiling source code, for example, it led the compiler to think
that the source file literally contained a question mark where the
unmappable character was found; the diagnostics the compiler reported
in these cases were thus confusing and misleading.  Unicode defines
the character U+FFFD specifically for the purpose of replacing source
characters that cannot be mapped to Unicode; this gives the compiler
and other consumers of mapped characters an unambiguous indication
that the original input character was unmappable.  The compiler uses
this new information to report a specific diagnostic message when it
finds a U+FFFD in the input stream.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.10 (8/17/2006)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Libraries (".tl" files) can now easily include their own
multimedia resources in a build.  In the past, there was no direct
support for multimedia resources in libraries; an author using a
library that included multimedia resources would have had to copy the
library resources into the game's directory tree and then explicitly
add those resources to the build.  This is no longer necessary.  Two
new features support library resources:

  <ul>

  <li>First, Workbench for Windows now automatically adds each
  top-level library's directory path to the search list for individual
  resource files (.jpg, .png, .ogg, etc).  Note that a "top-level"
  library is a library included directly in the Project window; a
  library included from within another library isn't top-level, so
  it's directory won't be included in the search list.  When running
  the game under the debugger, this allows individual resources to be
  found under any library's directory tree.

  <li>Second, the compiler accepts a new "resource:" keyword in
  library (.tl) files.  After this keyword, list one individual
  resource file, or one directory containing resource files.  You can
  use this keyword as many times as you like to include multiple files
  or directories.  As usual for library files, the file or directory
  mentioned after the "resource:" keyword is given with a URL-style
  relative path, relative to the library containing the library file.

  </ul>

These new features allow a library to include multimedia resources
with complete transparency to game authors using the library - game
authors won't have to do anything extra to use the library multimedia
resources.  Library authors only have to perform a few easy extra
steps.  First, create a subdirectory of your library directory to
contain the resources.  For example, if your library is called
mylib.tl, create a "mylibres" subdirectory under the directory
containing mylib.tl.  (The name isn't important, but it's desirable to
pick a unique enough name that there won't be any conflict with other
libraries that game authors might also be including.  Your resources
will be named relative to the subdirectory name, so don't pick a
generic name like "resources" - it's best to use a name that
incorporates your library name.)  Second, put all of your library's
resources (.jpg files, .png files, etc.) in your new subdirectory.
Third, add the line "resource: mylibres" to your .tl file; this will
tell the compiler to bundle all of the files in the "mylibres"
subdirectory into the compiled .t3 file when a game includes your
library.  Finally, in the HTML that your library generates to
reference your resources, refer to them using your subdirectory path -
for example, you'd write &lt;IMG SRC="mylibres/compass.png"&gt; to
refer to an image resource file.

<li>The <a href="sysman/t3vm.htm">t3GetStackTrace()</a>
function (in the 't3vm' function set) has a new optional argument that
lets you get information on a single stack level.  This provides more
efficient access to stack trace information in cases where you only
want information on a specific level, such as the immediate caller.

<li>When a game is compiled into a stand-alone executable (on systems
where this is implemented, such as Windows), it's now possible to pass
command-line arguments to the embedded .t3 program.  To do this, use a
dash ("-") to separate the interpreter arguments from the program
arguments.  The stand-alone version of the interpreter is also now
strict about not accepting an image file argument; this means that you
can't use a bundled stand-alone game to run a different .t3 image file.

<li>You can now write directly to the main game window's log file, if
one is open.  (This is the log file that's opened via the setLogFile()
function - the one that the library creates when the player types the
SCRIPT command.)  There are two ways to write to the log file.  The
simple way is to use the new &lt;LOG&gt; tag - this tag is simply the
complement of the &lt;NOLOG&gt; tag: any text enclosed between
&lt;LOG&gt; and &lt;/LOG&gt; will be included only in the log file,
and hidden in the game window.  This approach is usually the right
one, because you can mix your log-only text directly with other output
text, ensuring that it's processed through the usual stack of output
filters and the like.  However, on occasion it's useful to be able to
bypass the usual output stream mechanism, which brings us to the
second way: you can use logConsoleSay(), passing in the special handle
value MainWindowLogHandle as the handle.  Using this approach bypasses
mainOutputStream and all of its filters, and goes directly to the log
file.

<li>The compiler now warns on nested block comment ("/* ... */"
comments).  If the compiler finds a "/*" sequence within a block
comment, it generates a warning.  (Nested block comments aren't
allowed, so a "/*" within a block comment usually indicates that a
previous comment wasn't terminated properly.  The warning makes it
easier to notice such cases.)

<li>The compiler now automatically word-wraps error messages to 80
columns when the "verbose" error message option is selected.  This
makes the long error messages much easier to read, especially in
Workbench, which has an essentially infinitely wide message window -
the word-wrapping saves you the trouble of manually scrolling
horizontally to see the full message text.

<li>A bug in the compiler sometimes caused a crash if a 'foreach'
statement was used in a source file which never #included the system
headers.  The compiler correctly flagged the error, but didn't always
recover properly.  The compiler now handles this situation gracefully.

<li>A bug in the compiler caused the compiler to ignore the last line
of a library (.tl) file when the last line didn't end in a newline
character of some sort.  The same bug affected Workbench on Windows.
This has been corrected.

<li>A bug in the compiler caused incorrect results when a 'grammar'
statement's token list started with an empty alternative.  For
example, the token list "( | 'x')" was compiled incorrectly.  This
problem only occurred when the empty alternative was the <i>first</i>
element of the entire token list.  This has been corrected.

<li>In the past, the TadsObject type didn't retain 'undo' information
when the superclass list was changed with setSuperclassList().  This
meant that if an object's superclass was changed, an 'undo' operation
didn't properly restore the original superclass list.  This has been
corrected; this undo information is now properly retained and applied.

<li>A bug introduced in 3.0.9 caused the interpreter to misinterpret
certain Unicode characters outside of the plain ASCII range when
entered on a command line.  This has been fixed.

<li>A bug in TadsObject.setSuperclassList() caused sporadic problems.
The bug was most likely to manifest itself as a stack overflow error
when a call to self.setSuperclassList() was the first (or nearly the
first) executable code within a method.  The bug is now fixed.

<li>The regular expression parser didn't accept the special character
pattern &lt;tab&gt;, which is documented as matching the character
'\t' (or, equivalently, '\u0009').  This has been corrected.

<li>The regular expression parser didn't formerly classify as
whitespace several control characters that are conventionally
considered whitespace.  This was due to a strict interpretation of the
character properties defined in the Unicode character database, which
defines all of the ASCII control characters as class "Other" rather
than "Separator."  The Unicode database has some additional property
information, though, that does mark the appropriate control characters
as whitespace, and the character classifier now takes this extra
information into account.  This means that characters \u0009 (tab),
\u000A (line feed), \u000B (line tab), \u000C (form feed), \u000D
(carriage return), \u001c (IS4), \u001d (IS3), \u001e (IS2), and
\u001f (IS1) are now considered whitespace, and thus match the
&lt;space&gt; character class pattern in regular expressions.

<li class=last>In the past, the compiler always assumed it was running under a
DOS box, so it used the DOS box code page for any messages it
displayed.  On most systems, depending on localization, the DOS box
uses a different code page from the Windows code page used by native
Windows applications; this is because the DOS box is designed for
compatibility with old MS-DOS applications, which sometimes rely upon
the DOS line-drawing characters and so forth.  This occasionally
caused odd character mapping problems in error messages when compiling
from Workbench, because Workbench uses the standard Windows code page
instead of the DOS code page.  This has been corrected, as follows:
the compiler now checks to see if it's associated with a DOS box
window, and uses the DOS box code page for its error messages if so,
or the regular Windows code page if not.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.9 (8/29/2005)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The banner API has a new pair of style flags: BannerStyleHStrut
("horizontal strut") and BannerStyleVStrut ("vertical strut").  These
style flags let you specify that bannerSetSize() should take a child
banner's width (horizontal strut) and/or height (vertical strut) into
account when figuring the parent banner's content size.  By default,
only the contents of the parent banner are considered, but these new
styles let you include a child's contents in the parent banner's size
calculation.

<li>The File intrinsic class has a new feature in its various "open"
methods.  The filename passed to an "open" method can now be one of a
set of distinguished values (defined in file.h) that identify
"special" files.  These are files that are meant to be used for
particular purposes.  Rather than opening these files by name, you
open them by specifying their special identifiers.  The interpreter
determines the actual name and location of a special file in the local
file system.  This allows the interpreter to use different names of
paths on different systems, to better conform to local conventions.
Currently, there's only one special file defined: LibraryDefaultsFile,
which is a text file that's used to store the library's global
settings.

<li>The new GrammarProd method <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">
getGrammarInfo()</a> provides programmatic access to information on
GrammarProd objects, which allows the game to retrieve full
information on the 'grammar' statements in the source code.  Sample
code demonstrating how to use the new method to display a production's
internal information in human-readable format is included in the
samples directory, in the file gramdisp.t.

<li>The interpreter now uses the default file-contents character set
rather than the display character set as the default for log file
output.  On most systems, this change won't have any noticeable
effect, as the default display and file-contents character sets are
usually the same anyway.  However, on a few systems, the display and
file-contents character sets can differ; it makes more sense on these
systems to use the file-contents character set for log files than it
does to use the display character set, since it's usually desirable to
treat log files as ordinary text files.

<li>The new interpreter option "-csl <i>charset</i>" lets you
explicitly specify the character set for log files, overriding the
default.  (The default log file character set is the file-contents
character set, as described above.)

<li>The logConsoleCreate() function now accepts nil for the character
set argument.  This chooses the default log file character set.

<li>In tadsio.h, the constant InEvtNotimeout has been renamed to
InEvtNoTimeout (that is, the "T" in "Timeout" has been capitalized).
This change is simply cosmetic, for better consistency with the naming
convention that each word in a symbol name starts with a capital
letter.  (The "o" in "Timeout" is still a minuscule, and this is
consistent with the naming convention: in computerese, "timeout" is
usually considered a single word.)  To avoid breaking compatibility
with code based on previous versions, the old name is still defined as
a synonym for the new name.

<li>The Vector class's constructor now throws an error ("value out of
range") if the maximum-length argument exceeds 65535, which is the
maximum number of elements that a Vector can have.  (In the past,
attempting to create a vector with a maximum length of more than 65535
appeared to succeed, but didn't really; it actually created a vector
with a maximum of <i>n</i> mod 65536, where <i>n</i> was the given
length.)

<li>The compiler incorrectly considered the statement following a
'do-while' loop reachable if the loop's condition wasn't a constant
'true' expression, even if the condition itself was never reachable
and the loop contained no 'break' statements.  This caused the
compiler to issue spurious warnings in certain obscure situations,
such as when such a 'do-while' was at the end of a function that had
returned values elsewhere; it also caused the compiler to fail to
generate an "unreachable statement" warning when a statement followed
such a loop.  The compiler now correctly realizes that the statement
following such a loop is unreachable, and generates control flow
warnings accordingly.

<li>A compiler bug sometimes caused problems when generating code
involving a nested anonymous function (that is, an anonymous function
defined within another anonymous function), which was defined within
an object method, <i>and</i> which made reference to local variables
defined within two or more enclosing lexical contexts.  The problem
only affected code with all of these attributes, and then only showed
up some of the time.  The problem manifested itself as a spurious
run-time error ("invalid index operation - this type of value cannot
be indexed") when the nested anonymous function was invoked.  This
has been corrected.

<li>A bug in the compiler caused sporadic problems that sometimes
included crashing the compiler when source code contained a constant
expression involving a list indexed by a value exactly one greater
than the number of elements in the list, as in "[1,2][3]".  The
problem only occurred when everything in the expression - all of the
list elements, as well as the index value - was a constant.  This has
been fixed.

<li>Due to a bug, the compiler didn't recognize the "^="
(XOR-and-assign) operator.  This has been corrected.

<li>A bug in the rexGroup() function caused the interpreter to crash
in a particular, rare situation: specifically, when rexGroup() was
called immediately after a call to rexSearch() or rexMatch() that
caused a run-time error.  This has been corrected.

<li>A bug in the interpreter sometimes caused unpredictable behavior,
including crashes, when t3SetSay() was used to set a property pointer
handler, and a double-quoted string was then displayed from within a
function (not an object method).  This has been fixed.

<li>A bug in the interpreter's console-output subsystem's HTML
mini-parser caused subtle problems in some rare cases with the full
multimedia interpreters (but not in text-only interpreters).  For the
most part, in the full HTML interpreters, the console subsystem just
passes HTML markups directly through to the HTML renderer.  It does,
however, keep track of HTML sequences for its own purposes.  One of
these is to apply the "\^" and "\v" (capitalize and un-capitalize)
flags to actual text rather than to HTML markups.  The bug caused the
HTML tracker to lose track of where it was in an HTML sequence when a
tag included quoted attribute values.  The only known symptom of the
bug was that a "\^" or "\v" flag that appeared immediately before an
HTML tag that contained quoted attribute values was sometimes
misapplied to text within the HTML tag, effectively losing the effect
of the flag.  This has now been fixed.

<li>A bug in the Dictionary class caused problems when setting a
string comparator object that wasn't a StringComparator object.  The
Dictionary allowed setting the new comparator, but would then generate
a spurious error (usually "invalid type") on calling any of the
methods that called comparator methods (addWord, findWord, etc).  This
has been corrected.

<li>The Vector.copyFrom() method had a bug that caused the wrong
number of elements to be copied in some cases.  In particular, when
the destination vector had to be expanded to hold the new elements,
the method copied one fewer element than was requested.  This has been
fixed.

<li>A compiler bug caused duplicate "unreachable statement" to be
displayed when a 'switch' contained a case with an unreachable
'break' statement.  The duplicate messages no longer occur.

<li>Due to a bug, the compiler sometimes crashed if a 'switch'
statement contained an unreachable 'break' statement in one of its
cases, <i>and</i> the statement immediately after the 'switch' was
also unreachable.  This has been fixed.

<li>The compiler is now more consistent about where double-quoted
strings are allowed and not allowed.  First, superficial parentheses
are now accepted around double-quoted strings wherever the strings
would otherwise be legal.  Second, the comma operator can now be used
to juxtapose two or more double-quoted strings; the effect is simply
to display the strings in the order given, as though they had been
concatenated into a single string.  Third, the compiler formerly
accepted double-quoted strings, incorrectly, if they were used within
the 'true' or 'false' operands of a '?:' operator that was embedded
within any larger expression.  The compiler now correctly flags this
as an error.

<li>The compiler is now stricter about flagging errors for a few
syntactically invalid constructs that were formerly accepted.  It's
probably counterintuitive that more error messages are a good thing,
but, really, they are in cases like this - if a construct is invalid,
you're better off if the compiler catches it and tells you about it,
because otherwise the compiler is going to do something poorly defined
with the input.  Without an error message, it won't be obvious that
anything is amiss until the program starts behaving unexpectedly at
run-time.  The compiler now properly flags errors when it detects
these constructs.  Specifically, the compiler now enforces the
following grammar rules:

<ul>

<li>Each formal parameter in a 'propertyset' declaration, including
the "*" parameter, must be separated by exactly one comma from adjacent
parameters.

<li>'transient' cannot be used in the definition of a new template -
that is, "transient <i>class</i> template ..." is illegal.

<li>Empty templates ("<i>class</i> template;") are illegal.

<li>Parentheses are required around the condition expression of
a do-while statement.

</ul>

<li>The compiler now allows "local" declarations to be labeled
(via regular labels as well as "case" and "default" labels).  In
the past, the compiler didn't allow labeled local declarations.
There wasn't any good reason for this restriction; it was just
a quirk of the way the compiler's grammar was defined.

<li>The toString() function formerly failed on conversions to base 2
of a value over 262143, with a run-time exception.  This has been
corrected, so the function should now properly convert any 32-bit
integer value to a base 2 string representation.

<li>The toInteger() function now accepts base 2 as the input format.

<li>The compiler is now more tolerant of different newline formats in
library (.tl) files.  In the past, the compiler generally expected .tl
files to conform to local newline conventions; this made it more
difficult to re-use libraries on different operating systems, since it
was sometimes necessary to convert newlines first.  Source code files
(.t and .h files) were never affected by this, but the part of the
compiler that read .tl files wasn't as flexible.  The compiler's .tl
file reader now accepts essentially any newline format: it will accept
newlines consisting of CR-LF sequences, LF-CR sequences, simple CR
newlines, and simple LF newlines.  It doesn't matter what your
computer's native newline conventions are - every port of the compiler
will now accept any of these formats.

<li class=last>Due to a bug, the compiler's macro preprocessor didn't properly
expand macros that included the #ifempty or #ifnempty operators.
In particular, any text in the macro's definition prior to the
#ifempty or #ifnempty was effectively discarded; the text wasn't
included in the expansion.  This is now fixed.


</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.8 (9/12/2004)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The compiler now enforces unique naming for all of the modules in
a project.  Using the same name for two (or more) modules can cause
problems, mostly because both modules would have the same filename for
their object files and thus one would overwrite the other.  In the
past, when a module name conflict caused this kind of problem, the
compiler reported the errors caused by the name collision, but it
wasn't always easy to figure out that the name collision was the root
cause.  To avoid this potential source of confusion, the compiler now
checks the entire project for module name collisions, and flags an
error if any collisions are found.

<li>The "file safety" levels have changed slightly to provide better
security against malicious game programs.  First, level 2, which
formerly provided global read access but no write access, now instead
provides read/write access to the current working directory only (the
game isn't allowed any access to files outside of the working
directory).  Second, the default safety level is now level 2.  In the
past, level 1 (read from any file/write to current directory only) was
the default, which left open the possibility that a game could access
data outside of the working directory.  A malicious game could
conceivably have exploited this by, for example, secretly copying
sensitive data to the game directory for later use by a coordinating
network worm, or by encoding the data in a hyperlink (displayed in an
HTML-enabled game) that takes the player to a spyware site when
clicked.  The new default setting should effectively eliminate these
risks by barring access to any files outside of the working directory.

<li>Several of the system headers formerly lacked #include directives
for other headers they depended upon.  This didn't cause problems most
of the time, since the necessary headers were usually included from
somewhere else anyway, but it meant that you had to include system
headers in the right order to avoid compiler errors.  Each of the
system headers now explicitly includes any other headers it depends
upon, which ensures that each system header can be included in
isolation, and in any order with respect to other headers.

<li>The saveGame(), restoreGame(), and restartGame() intrinsic
functions can now be called from recursive VM invocations (that is,
from contexts where a call to an intrinsic function or method has
invoked a byte-code callback function, such as an anonymous function
passed to an iteration method on a collection object).  This restriction
was needed in the distant past, but it's been vestigial since version
3.0.5a (when the save/restore mechanism was overhauled to exlude the
call stack and execution context from the saved state information).
Since the restriction is no longer necessary, it's now been removed.

<li>In the intrinsic function getLocalCharSet(), the new constant
CharsetFileCont can be used to retrieve the name of the character set
typically used for the contents of text files on the local system.
(Note that this is only the <i>typical</i> character set for text
files on the local system; there's no guarantee that any particular
file uses this character set.  The actual character set of a given
text file is determined by the user and application that created the
file.)

<li>In tadsio.h, the constant CharsetFile (for use with the
getLocalCharSet() function) has been renamed to CharsetFileName.  The
name change is to emphasize that the constnat refers to the character
set used in the local file system for <i>names</i> of files, as
opposed to the <i>contents</i> of text files.

<li>The compiler sometimes incorrectly complained about a missing
option argument when a "-x" option (with a valid argument supplied)
was used at the very end of a command line.  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>A bug in the compiler occasionally caused floating point constants
that included exponential ("E" suffixes) to be mis-parsed.  When this
happened, one or more spurious, random extra digits of precision were
added to the end of the number's mantissa.  This has been corrected.

<h3>Changes for 3.0.7 (6/12/2004)</h3>

<p><i>There are no changes to the compiler or interpreter core in
this release.  The only changes in the adv3 library and the
Windows HTML TADS interpreter.</i>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6q (5/9/2004)</h3>

<p><i>There are no changes to the compiler or interpreter core in this
release.  The only changes are in the adv3 library and the Windows
HTML TADS interpreter.</i>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6p (4/25/2004)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The regular expression parser now accepts the special character
codes &lt;lbrace&gt; and &lt;rbrace&gt; for left and right "curly"
braces, "{" and "}", respectively.  Since curly braces are special
characters in regular expressions, it's convenient to have named
character codes for them.

<li>In the past, the regular expression parser accepted a closure
modifier (a "*", for example) directly following an assertion
expression.  Since assertions don't consume any input text, repeating
one with a closure doesn't change the meaning of an expression, so a
closure following an assertion is meaningless.  However, doing so had
the undesirable effect of creating an infinite loop, as the regular
expression matcher tried pointlessly to find out how many times a
successful assertion could be successful (the answer is always: as
many times as you try).  The regular expression parser now avoids such
infinite loops by simply ignoring any closure modifier that's applied
to an assertion.  (Note, however, that you can still trick the parser
into building an infinite loop with a more complex expression.  For
example, you can enclose one or more assertions in parentheses, and
then apply a closure to the parenthesized group.  The regexp parser
isn't sophisticated enough to detect these more subtle infinite loops;
it can only detect the obvious kind where a closure is applied
directly to an assertion.)

<li>A bug in the compiler caused incorrect results when an anonymous
function referred to a property of "self," when the function was
defined within a list value of a property.  The property evaluation
within the anonymous function typically yielded nil in these cases,
even when that property had a non-nil value in the object containing
the property with the list value containing the anonymous function.
The same problem showed up whether the property containing the list
value was defined with the ordinary "prop = val" syntax or with a
template.  This has been corrected; properties of self will now yield
correct results in these cases.  To be more concrete, in the example
below, evaluating testObj.prop1[1]() should display "hello!" on the
console, and now does this correctly; but in the past, this example
displayed nothing, because the evaluation of prop2 within the
anonymous function yielded nil.

<p><pre>  testObj: object 
    prop1 = [ {: say(prop2) } ] 
    prop2 = 'hello!'  
  ;
</pre>

<li>A bug in the compiler caused the compiler to crash in some cases
when presented with an anonymous function within a list value of an
object property defined with a template.  The problem has been
corrected.

<li>The compiler incorrectly reported a standard-level warning when a
function or method "list parameter" was unused within the function or
method.  (A list parameter is a formal parameter defined in square
brackets to indicate that it receives a list containing the actual
parameters, which can vary in number, when the method is called.)  The
compiler also incorrectly reported the warning as an assigned but
unused value; it should have reported it as an unused parameter
instead.  The compiler now reports the correct warning, and only
reports it at "pedantic" level; this makes the handling of list
parameters consistent with the treatment of ordinary formal
parameters.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6o (3/14/2004)</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last>The MIME type for saved position files has been changed to
"application/x-t3vm-state".  The Windows installers have been updated
to reflect the new MIME type.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6n (3/6/2004)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The debugger now automatically includes "self" in the local
variable list whenever examining a frame in which "self" is valid.

<li>On Windows, the installers now add the MIME type for the compiled
game file type (.t3) and the saved position file type (.t3v) to the
system registry.  This information can be helpful to applications,
particularly those that perform file transfers.  (The MIME type for
a compiled game is "application/x-t3vm-image", and the type for
saved position files is "application/x-t3vm-save".)

<li>A compiler bug caused the compiler to crash when certain obscure
kinds of syntax errors occurred inside nested object definitions.
This has been corrected.

<li>A bug in the compiler caused the compiler to crash when it was
attempting to parse a one-line function or method that contained an
unclosed anonymous function.  The problem was most likely to be seen
when the errant one-liner was the last thing in a source file.  The
compiler now generates appropriate error messages and terminates
normally.

<li>A bug in the ByteArray class caused the VM to crash when a
ByteArray was used as a key in a LookupTable.  This has been
corrected.

<li>A bug in the BigNumber class caused the VM to crash in some cases
when a string was used as the source value to construct a new
BigNumber.  This should now work reliably.

<li>A bug in the debugger caused a crash when execution stopped
inside an anonymous function with no 'self' context.  The most common
place to encounter this problem was at a run-time error in an
anonymous function defined inside a list, such as in an EventList
object.  The problem has been corrected.

<li>On Windows, the Author's Kit installer failed to create the
samples\obj subdirectory.  That subdirectory is required to build
the sample game (sample.t3m) included in the kit, so you had to
manually create the directory before you could compile the game.
The installer now automatically creates the directory.

<li class=last>The BigNumber class incorrectly returned a result of zero when
dividing zero by zero.  (This only happened when the dividend was
zero; for other dividend values, a divide-by-zero exception was
correctly thrown.)  This now throws a divide-by-zero exception.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6m (11/15/2003)</h3>

<p><i>Note: 3.0.6l was a library-only release, so there was no system
release called 3.0.6l.</i>

<ul>

<li>The propNotDefined mechanism is now invoked when 'inherited'
fails to find a base class implementation of the method being
inherited.  This works almost exactly the same way it does when
propNotDefined is invoked during a normal method/property call,
with only one difference: when 'inherited' fails to find a base
class property, it searches for a 'propNotDefined' using the
same search pattern it used to seek the original inherited
property.  For example, consider this code:

<p><pre>
  export propNotDefined;

  class A: object
    propNotDefined(prop, [args]) { "This is A.propNotDefined\n"; }
  ;

  class B: A
    propNotDefined(prop, [args]) { "This is B.propNotDefined\n"; }
    p1() { inherited(); }
  ;

  main(args)
  {
    local x = new B();
    x.p1();
  }
</pre>

<p>When this program is run, the result displayed will be "This is
A.propNotDefined".  B.p1() attempts to inherit the base class
definition of p1(); when it doesn't find an inherited definition, it
searches for propNotDefined() using the same search pattern it used
to find the inherited p1().  That is, the search starts with B's
superclass, because that's where the search for the inherited p1()
started from.

<li>The t3SetSay() intrinsic function now returns the previous default
output function or method.  (The return value corresponds to the
argument value: if the argument sets a new function pointer, the
return value is the old function pointer; if the argument is a new
property ID, the return value is the old property ID.)  This allows
code to save the old value for later restoration, if desired.  In
addition, the new special argument values T3SetSayNoFunc and
T3SetSayNoMethod can be specified to cancel any existing default
output function or method, respectively, and the function returns
these values when needed to indicate the absence of a previous
setting.

<li>The t3SetSay() function now accepts an anonymous function as
the default output function.  (In the past, only a regular named
function was acceptable.)

<li>When propNotDefined() is invoked, the interpreter now sets
'targetprop' to &amp;propNotDefined.  In the past, the interpreter
incorrectly set 'targetprop' to the property originally invoked.
This was incorrect; one important consequence was that it didn't
allow propNotDefined() itself to use 'inherited' to invoke the base
class's implementation.

<li>The compiler now automatically adds a property called
'sourceTextOrder' to each non-class object defined in a source file.
The value of the property is an integer giving the object's order in
the source file in which it's defined.  This value is defined to
increase monotonically throughout a source file, so you can use it to
sort a collection of objects into the same order in which they appear
in the source text.  This property is useful when you want to create
an initialized structure of objects (such as a list or a tree), and
you want objects within the structure to have the same order at
run-time that they have in the source text.  In the past, there was
no straightforward way to guarantee source text ordering, because
the compiler and linker assign object ID's in arbitrary order.
This new property is guaranteed to reflect the original source
text order, so you can use it to initialize the run-time order.
Note that a 'modify' statement doesn't assign a new sourceTextOrder
to the underlying object; the original sourceTextOrder is retained
for a modified object.  Note also that sourceTextOrder only tells you
the relative order of objects within a single source file; the compiler
resets the counter at the start of each new source file, so it's not
meaningful to compare sourceTextOrder values for objects in different
source modules.

<li>The toInteger() function now accepts an integer value as its
first argument.  If the first argument is an integer, the function
simply returns the same value; the optional second argument (the
radix value) is ignored if present.

<li>The BigNumber constructor now accepts another BigNumber as the
source value.  This creates a new BigNumber with the given source
value at an optional new precision, rounding the original value if
the new precision is less than that of the source value.

<li>The BigNumber method formatString() incorrectly returned an empty
string when formatting a fractional number if the maximum digit count
for formatting was insufficient to reach the first non-zero digit of
the fractional value.  For example, 0.0001.formatString(3) returned
an empty string.  The method now returns '0' for these cases.

<li>In most of the character-mode interpreters, if a line of
highlighted or colored text appeared just before a "MORE" prompt,
subsequent text was incorrectly highlighted or colored like the
line before the "MORE" prompt.  This has been fixed.

<li>The character-mode interpreters very occasionally crashed on exit,
due to a bug in the termination code.  This has been corrected.

<li>In most of the character-mode interpreters that support the
"-plain" mode, the interpreter is now more thorough about flushing
the standard output before stopping to read input.  This makes the
plain mode interoperate better with other programs using "pipes"
and similar OS-specific input/output redirection.  This change pertains
to the MS-DOS and Unix versions, and to any other platforms based on
the common character-mode layer (known technically as "osgen3").

<li>The rand() function now accepts a Vector as its argument.
A vector argument behaves the same as a list argument: the function
randomly chooses one of the elements of the vector and returns it.

<li>A bug in the TadsObject.createInstanceOf() method caused an
incorrect value to be left on the VM stack during creation of the
new object.  This showed up as an incorrect argument value if a
method was invoked on the new object as part of the createInstanceOf()
expression.  This has been corrected.

<li>The text-only interpreters incorrectly paid attention to a
&lt;BODY&gt; tag within an &lt;ABOUTBOX&gt; tag, setting any color
scheme specified in the &lt;BODY&gt; tag.  This improperly set the
main text window to the color scheme intended only for use inside
the about-box.  This no longer occurs.

<li>The forEachAssoc() method of the List and Vector intrinsic classes
incorrectly passed a zero-based index for the 'key' parameter to the
callback (that is, the first element was identified by index 0, the
second by index 1, etc., C-style).  This should have been a one-based
index for consistency with all of the other indexing operations for
List and Vector.  This is now fixed.

<li>Vector.setLength() will now throw an error if the given length
is less than zero.  (In the past, it accepted an invalid length,
leading to unpredictable results.)

<li>Under certain conditions, the debugger didn't stop in response to
a "Break" key (Ctrl-C, Ctrl+Break, or whatever key is appropriate to
local convention).  In particular, if a single line of code contained
an infinite loop, and the user ran the program, broke into the loop
once, and then resumed execution, the debugger ignored subsequent
break keys.  This has been corrected.

<li>The compiler incorrectly reported errors in the branches of an
'if' statement at the line of the 'if' itself if the branches were
bare statements (not enclosed in braces).  The same applied to
'while', 'for', and 'do while' statements when their bodies were bare
statements.  The compiler now reports these errors at the
sub-statement locations.

<li>The compiler generated an incorrect debugger line number record
under certain obscure circumstances: if the source file contained an
object or class based on multiple superclasses, and the class didn't
define an explicit constructor, then the compiler generated an
incorrect line record for the last executable line of code in the
file.  This is now fixed.

<li>The compiler now shows Unicode escape sequences when displaying an
error message containing characters from the source file that can't be
represented in the compiler console character set.  For example, if
you're running the compiler in a terminal window on Unix, and your
terminal window is set up to display Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) characters,
and you're compiling a source file prepared in Latin-2, your terminal
window would be unable to correctly display some of the characters in
the source file, because Latin-2 has characters that aren't part of
Latin-1.  In the past, if any of these "unmappable" characters were
shown as part of a compiler error message, the compiler showed them as
question marks.  Now, the compiler shows them as "backslash" escape
sequences.  For exampe, Latin-2 character 171, "T with caron," would
be displayed as "\u0164", since its Unicode code is 0x164.  This
change doesn't affect the display of compatible characters - all
mappable characters will still be displayed in the local character
set.  This only affects characters that were formerly displayed as
question marks.

<li>The default "file safety level" is now 1, which allows reading
from any file and writing only to the current working directory.
This default setting provides games with reasonable flexibility, but
helps prevent the possibility that a malicious author can modify
important files on your hard disk by limiting writing operations to
the game's working directory only.  You can override this using
the "-s" option if you want to set a more permissive or more
restrictive safety level.

<li>In Workbench for Windows, the "Build for Release" command
didn't properly invoke the "t3res" command for building external
resource files (.3r0, etc).  This now works properly.

<li>A problem in the debugger caused sporadic bad behavior when a
finalizer method threw an exception (out of the finalize() method;
throwing around exceptions within a finalizer was fine, as long as the
exception was caught entirely within the finalizer).  This manifested
itself in numerous different ways, ranging from no visible effects
to full Workbench crashes.  The problem only occurred in the debugger;
the regular non-debug VM didn't have the problem.  This has now
been corrected.

<li>The VM now recovers more gracefully from stack overflow
exceptions.  In the past, stack overflows tended to be unrecoverable
because the VM would usually encounter a second stack overflow in the
course of trying to create an exception object to represent the
original stack overflow, forcing the VM to terminate the game
summarily to avoid an infinite loop of exceptions thrown while
handling exceptions thrown while handling exceptions, ad infinitum.
The VM now keeps a small emergency reserve of stack space for
handling stack overflow errors, which should in most cases allow an
exception object to be created normally, which in turn allows the
game to catch and handle the exception just like any other run-time
error.

<li>The debugger now gives you more flexibility in recovering from
stack overflow errors.  In the past, if your program caused a stack
overflow (due to infinite recursion, for example), the debugger
itself was unable to evaluate expressions without itself encountering
stack overflows, since the debugger shares the stack with the VM.
The debugger now holds some of the stack in reserve specifically for
handling stack overflows; when a stack overflow occurs, the debugger
uses the reserve for its own purposes, allowing you to evaluate
expressions and carry on normally within the debugger.  This makes it
easier to figure out why the stack overflow occurred.  Note that you
can often use the debugger to recover from a stack overflow by
manually moving the execution pointer to a 'return' statement (or the
end of the method), breaking off the infinite recursion that caused
the overflow.

<li class=last>The debugger now shows anonymous functions more descriptively in
stack traces.  In the past, these showed a string like
"[1234].prop#0(5,6)"; now, the debugger shows "{anonfn:1234}(5,6)"
instead.  The "1234" is an internal object identifier for the
anonymous function; this conveys no specific human-readable meaning
other than to distinguish one function from another.  The
corresponding change has also been made in reflect.t, in
reflectionServices.formatStackFrame().

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6k (8/17/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The debugger now supports stop-on-change conditional breakpoints.
When you create a breakpoint with a condition expression, the debugger
now offers a choice between stopping when the expression evaluates to
true or stopping when the expression's value changes.  In the past,
there was no choice, and only stop-when-true conditions were
supported.  Stop-on-change is now the default when creating a new
global breakpoint.

<li>The system.tl library now includes the default system startup
module, _main.t.  In addition, it sets the new library flag, "nodef",
to indicate that the library replaces the default system modules that
the compiler would otherwise include in the build automatically.  This
change primarily benefits users of Workbench for Windows, in that it
causes Workbench to include _main.t explicitly in the list of source
files.  This makes it more convenient to view the file within
Workbench, set breakpoints inside it, and trace into it.  (This change
will have no effect on most existing games.  The only games affected
would be those that include system.tl <i>and</i> include a
non-standard startup module, using the "-nodef" compiler flag to
suppress the default inclusion of _main.t.  This is an unlikely
scenario, but if it applies, here's what to do: drop the "-nodef"
compiler flag from your project file, and instead add "-x _main"
immediately after the "-lib system" inclusion.)

<li>The new directive "nodef" can appear within a library (.tl) file.
This instructs the compiler that the library includes the same modules
that the compiler would include by default, or replacements for the
standard modules.  If a library includes the "nodef" directive, then
including that library in the build has the same effect as including
the "-nodef" option on the compiler command line or in the project
(.t3m) file.

<li>In the past, the text-only interpreters didn't properly handle banner
size settings that exceeded the available screen size.  The text-only
interpreters will now limit a banner's size to the available space on
the screen when the requested size is too large.

<li>The AnonFuncPtr intrinsic class now correctly identifies itself as
a subclass of Vector (via ofKind and getSuperclassList).

<li>The AnonFuncPtr intrinsic class now compares and hashes by
reference, rather than by value as its Vector base class does.

<li>The banner function bannerSetSize(), when applied to a text window
(BannerTypeText), now takes into account the space used for margins
and borders when sizing in "absolute" units.  This ensures that if you
ask for a height of five rows, for example, then the window will
actually be large enough to display five rows in the default font,
without any scrolling.  In the past, the margins weren't taken into
account, so the actual capacity of a banner wasn't necessarily
the same as the requested nominal size in absolute units.

<li>The run-time symbol table now omits "intrinsic class modifier"
objects.  These objects have been filtered out of firstObj/nextObj
iterations since 3.0.6c; they're now filtered out of the symbol table
for the same reasons, and for consistency with firstObj/nextObj.  (In
the past, these objects appeared as symbols of type object, with names
of the form " 99", and with no superclasses.  These are internal
implementation objects that are meaningless to the game program, so
there's no reason for the symbol table to include them.)

<li>A problem in the List and String classes caused the VM to crash in
certain very rare cases when evaluating properties of constant list or
string values.  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>A bug in the Dictionary intrinsic class's findWord() method
sometimes caused strange behavior, most noticeably as corruptions in
the values of local variables in the invoking code.  The problem only
occurred when the method was called in its single-argument form.  The
problem has been fixed.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6j (8/2/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The new TadsObject method setSuperclassList() enables the game
program to change an object's superclass list dynamically.  The
method takes a list giving the new superclass list for the object.

<li>It's now legal to explicitly define a 'location' property in an
object definition that also uses the '+' notation to set the object's
location.  The compiler specifically treats an explicit 'location'
property setting as overriding the value set with the '+' notation,
rather than considering the redefinition a conflict as it did in the
past.  This allows logically related object definitions to be kept
close together in the source code even when some of the objects are
part of a location tree and others are not; this happens fairly
frequently, because simulation objects sometimes have abstract helper
objects that don't participate in the normal location hierarchy.

<li>Templates can now include alternative groups that are optional.
If any element of an alternative group is marked as optional, then
the whole group of alternatives is optional.

<li>The new macro perInstance(expr), defined in the system header
file tads.h, can be used to define a property in a class such that
the property will be set to the value of the expression 'expr'
separately for each instance of the class.  For each instance,
the expression is evaluated the first time that instance's value
of the property is accessed, and then stored with that instance.

<li>The compiler now has the ability to bundle resource files into
the image (.t3) file as part of the main compilation ("t3make") step,
without running the "t3res" utility as a separate step.  This lets
you include resource files in your project's makefile (the .t3m
file), which means the makefile can now specify the entire build
procedure for most types of projects.  To add resources with t3make,
add the new "-res" option <i>after</i> all of your source and library
modules in the .t3m file, and list your resource files after the "-res"
option.  The syntax for the resource list following the "-res" option
is the same as the "t3res" utility, except that the "-add" option is
not allowed (as adding resources is the only possibility).

<li>Workbench for Windows now allows you to add a resource file to a
project before the resource file exists.  To add a resource file that
you haven't yet created, use the usual menu command to add a resource
file, then type the name of the file into the file selector dialog.
The dialog will allow you to type the name of a file that doesn't
yet exist.  This is handy when you want to include a resource file
that won't be created until your pre-initialization code runs, such
as the "gameinfo.txt" file.

<li>The compiler is now able to determine automatically if relinking
is needed due to a change in the set of modules included in the build.
This is accomplished by checking a small bit of additional data in the
.t3 about the set of object modules involved in the build.  (The new
information is simply a 32-bit "checksum" of the module source file
list, so it adds only four bytes to the image file.  It's not enough
information to allow a user to recover a list of your source files by
reverse-engineering the image file, so you don't have to worry about
any possibility that a user could obtain "hints" this way.  Because
only a checksum is stored, there's a very small possibility that a
change to the source file list could result in an identical checksum,
in which case the compiler would not notice that relinking is
required.  The probability of this happening is extremely small, but
if you ever suspect it, you can always use the "-al" option to force a
relink.)  Note that this doesn't affect the compiler's use of file
timestamps to determine build dependencies; this is simply an
additional check the compiler makes to detect when a new module is
added to the build or an old module is removed.

<li>The ByteArray intrinsic class has two new methods, readInt() and
writeInt(), that make it easy to translate between integer values and
byte representations of those values.  This is especially useful for
reading and writing binary files.  The new methods let you read and
write integers in 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit sizes, signed or unsigned,
and in little-endian or big-endian format.

<li>The File intrinsic class has a new method, getFileSize(), which
returns the size in bytes of the file.

<li>A bug in the File intrinsic class sometimes caused the VM to
crash when a read operation was attempted after a seek operation.
This has been corrected.

<li>The starter game templates now include startup handling for
startup-and-restore.  When the player launches the interpreter using a
saved-game file, the interpreter invokes the startup-and-restore code,
which the game must provide in a routine called mainRestore().  The
starter templates now include a mainRestore() routine, and handle
main() and mainRestore() using a common subroutine called
mainCommon().  This change will make it much simpler for authors to
include proper startup-and-restore support in their games, by
providing a ready-made framework with the necessary code.

<li>Fixed a bug in Workbench for Windows: checkboxes in the Project
window didn't work for nested libraries; clicking on the checkbox
for a nested library simply had no effect.  These checkboxes now
work properly; clicking on a library checkbox checks or unchecks
the library and all of the files within the library.

<li>The Win32 character-mode interpreter (t3run.exe) now includes
a desktop icon in the executable file.  This allows you to use the
"-icon" option with maketrx32 to add your own custom icons to games
you bundle as executables using the console-mode interpreter.

<li>A bug in the regular expression matcher failed to handle the
shortest-match closure modifier (specified with a '?' suffix to a
'*' or '?'  operator) properly.  This bug was introduced in the
regular expression processor rework in 3.0.6h, and has now been
corrected.

<li>In certain unusual cases, the debugger incorrectly included a
property in property enumerations when the property was actually a
method.  This happened when a method overrode a property defined as a
simple data value in a superclass.  The debugger isn't meant to show
methods in property enumerations, since invoking a method will
naturally invoke any side effects of the method.  This has been
corrected.

<li>In Workbench for Windows, projects created in the root directory
of a disk (C:\, D:\, etc) caused a number of problems, including
crashes during compilation.  These problems have been corrected, so
creating a project in a root directory is now safe.

<li>In Workbench for Windows, the compiler incorrectly wrote the
object files to the working object directory when compiling for
release, overwriting the object files for the debug build.  This
didn't do any harm apart from requiring a full recompile for debugging
after any release build, which the compiler automatically sensed and
performed, but it caused an unnecessary delay.  The compiler now
correctly sends release build object files to a temporary directory,
so that the debug build object files are retained through a release
build.

<li>The new-project wizard in Workbench for Windows will no longer
accept a source filename that ends in an extension reserved for
makefiles or compiler-generated files (.t3m, .t3, .t3o, .t3s).  This
makes it more difficult to accidentally create a source file that will
be overwritten by the compiler or by Workbench with generated files.

<li>The compiler will now recompile an object file if the symbol file
is more recent.  Compilations that fail due to a syntax error can
leave a project partially compiled, so that all of the symbol files
but not all of the object files have been recompiled.  In the past,
correcting such an error and then recompiling did not always compile
all of the necessary modules.  This change ensures that all modules
noted as requiring compilation on the first attempt will be noted
again on subsequent attempts, even if the first attempt fails part-way
through.

<li>Due to a bug in the VM, throwing exceptions out of a native-code
callback context (such as out of the callback to a Vector or
LookupTable iteration method) sometimes caused the VM to lose track of
the calling exception handlers; this caused symptoms such as sending
the exception to a "catch" block other than the innermost eligible
one.  This problem tended to show up when an exception was thrown out
of a callback context, and then the same exception was thrown again on
a later invocation.  This has been corrected.

<li>If a Vector contains a reference to itself, or to a Vector
containing a reference to the first Vector, indirectly to any depth,
then an attempt to compare the Vector to another Vector, or an attempt
to use the Vector as a key in a LookupTable, will fail with a run-time
exception ("maximum equality test/hash recursion depth exceeded").
Since Vector equality comparisons and hash calculations are defined
recursively by value, Vectors with direct or indirect self-references
cause the equality and hash calculations to recurse infinitely; the
Vector class avoids this infinite recursion by throwing the exception
when the recursion becomes too deep.  Note that this also effectively
limits the depth of a Vector tree when used in an equality test or
hash value calculation, even if the tree is acyclic; the limit is
256 levels.

<li>When reading input from a script (using the REPLAY command, for
example), the interpreter now ignores morePrompt() calls.  This
allows script replay to proceed unattended, without unnecessary
interactive pauses.

<li class=last>In the debugger, if the game was interrupted by a real-time event
while the player was editing a command line, and the debugger took
control (via a breakpoint, for example) inside the real-time event,
and the game was then terminated from within the debugger (while
still stepping through the real-time event code) and then later
restarted, a bug in the console manager caused strange behavior,
sometimes including crashing the debugger.  This has been corrected.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6i (6/15/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Due to a compiler bug, when a template was defined using the "|"
symbol to list a set of alternatives for a token position, object
definitions using the template failed to match the last alternative
of a set.  All alternatives in a set are now properly recognized.

<li>The gameinfo.t module has been removed.  In its place is a new
mechanism in the library that writes the GameInfo file automatically
during pre-initialization, based on the definitions in the game's
GameID object.

<li>The Tokenizer class now gives each rule a name, which is simply a
string value by which the rule can be identified.  This changes the
format of the rule list entries - each rule list entry has the new
name value as its first element.  Any subclasses or modifications
of Tokenizer must use the new rule format.

<li class=last>The Tokenizer class has some new methods that allow rules to be
added or removed.  insertRule(rule, curName, after) inserts the new
rule given by 'rule' before or after the existing rule named
'curName'; the new rule is inserted before the existing rule if
'after' is nil, after the existing rule if 'after' is true.
insertRuleAt(rule, idx) inserts the new rule given by 'rule' at the
index given by 'idx' in the rule list.  deleteRule(name) deletes the
existing rule with the given name, and deleteRuleAt(idx) deletes the
existing rule at the given index in the rule list.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6h (6/7/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The "modify" keyword can now be used to define functions.  Modifying
a function works just like replacing a function with the "replace" keyword,
except that the new function can invoke the previous version of the
function by using the "replaced" keyword.  Refer to the
<a href="sysman/proccode.htm">Procedural Code</a> section of the
documentation for details.

<li>Two new TadsObject methods, createInstanceOf() and
createTransientInstanceOf(), enable a program to dynamically
instantiate an object based on multiple superclasses.  Refer to the <a
href="sysman/tadsobj.htm">TadsObject reference</a> for
details of the new methods.

<li>The <a href="sysman/objdef.htm">object template</a> syntax has
been extended to include optional elements and alternative elements.
An element is marked optional by placing a question mark after it;
alternative elements are separated by '|' tokens.

<li>Several string search and regular expression intrinsics accept a
new optional argument specifying the starting index in the string for
the search.  If the index argument is specified, then the search will
start from the given character index; the index value 1 indicates
that the search starts from the first character of the string, which
is the default if the index parameter is omitted.  This change allows
algorithms that search for repeated occurrences of a substring or
pattern to be written more efficiently, since they won't have to
split up the source string to continue searching for additional
occurrences.

  <ul>
     <li>String.find(str, index?)
     <li>String.findReplace(origStr, newStr, flags, index?)
     <li>rexMatch(pat, str, index?)
     <li>rexSearch(pat, str, index?)
     <li>rexReplace(pat, str, replacement, flags, index?)
  </ul>

<li>A new banner style flag, BannerStyleMoreMode, causes a banner
window to use "MORE" mode.  This means that any time text displayed to
the banner fills the available vertical space in the banner window,
the interpreter will display some sort of prompt to the user, and then
wait for the user to acknowledge the prompt.  The exact nature of the
prompt and acknowledgment varies by platform; usually, the interpreter
displays a prompt like "[MORE]" at the bottom of the overflowing
window, and waits for the user to press a key.  The purpose of MORE
mode is to ensure that the user always has a chance to read all of the
displayed text before it scrolls off the screen.  Note that
BannerStyleMoreMode implies BannerStyleAutoVScroll, since it only
makes sense to pause for a MORE prompt when new text would cause old
text to scroll away, and this only happens when the auto-vscroll style
is used.

<li>The forEachInstance() function now allows the callback to break
out of the iteration loop by throwing a BreakLoopSignal exception.
Throwing this exception simply terminates the loop and returns to
the caller of forEachInstance().  You can conveniently throw the
exception using the "breakLoop" macro (defined in tads.h).

<li>A new utility function has been added to the base library (in
_main.t): instanceWhich(<i>cls</i>, <i>func</i>).  This function
iterates over instances of the given class <i>cls</i>, and calling
<i>func</i> on each instance; <i>func</i> is a pointer to a function
taking one parameter, which is the current instance in the iteration.
instanceWhich() returns the first instance for which the callback
function <i>func</i> returns a non-nil and non-zero value.  Note that
the function iterates instances in arbitrary order, so if there are
multiple instances of <i>cls</i> for which <i>func</i> returns true,
the return value will simple be the first of these visited in the
arbitrary iteration order.  If <i>func</i> doesn't return a
non-nil/non-zero value for any instance of <i>cls</i>, the function
returns nil.

<li>The setLogFile() function now takes an optional second parameter
specifying the type of log file to open or close.  The possible values
are LogTypeTranscript, to create a transcript of all input and output;
and LogTypeCommand, to create a record of only the input commands.
The default, if the parameter is omitted, is LogTypeTranscript.

<li>The character mapper now accepts the IANA standard names for
the various Unicode encodings supported in TADS 3: "UTF-8", "UTF-16BE"
(for the 16-bit big-endian encoding), and "UTF-16LE" (for the 16-bit
little-endian encoding).  These names are case-insensitive, and can
be used anywhere a character encoding name is required (#charset,
new Charset(), etc).  The old non-standard names for the same
character sets ("utf8", "unicodeb", and "unicodel") are still accepted
as well.

<li>The compiler now accepts source files that start with a Unicode
UTF-16 byte-order marker (i.e., the "FF FE" or "FE FF" byte sequences)
and <i>also</i> specify a #charset directive.  The #charset directive
in such cases must (1) itself be encoded in the 16-bit Unicode
encoding implied by the byte-order marker, and (2) designate the
character set name that matches the byte-order marker (so a file
encoded in big-endian UTF-16 must have a #charset "utf-16be"
directive, and a file encoded in little-endian UTF-16 must have a
#charset "utf-16le" directive).  The #charset directive is optional in
these cases, since the compiler can correctly infer the encoding based
on the byte-order marker alone.

<li>The compiler now accepts source files that start with a Unicode
UTF-8 byte-order marker.  The compiler infers that the file is encoded
in UTF-8 if it sees this sequence.  Note that there is only one valid
UTF-8 encoding, so the UTF-8 byte order marker is always the same
(i.e., there is no "big-endian" or "little-endian" flavor of UTF-8;
there's only UTF-8).  A #charset "utf-8" directive is allowed but not
required immediately after the UTF-8 three-byte byte-order marker
sequence.  This change is required because some text editors that save
in UTF-8 format write the byte-order marker character at the start of
the file.

<li>A new compiler option, -quotefname, tells the compiler to quote
filenames when reporting the source file location of an error.  If
this option is specified, the compiler encloses these filenames in
double quotes, and "stutters" any double-quote characters that are
part of the filenames themselves (that is, each double-quote character
that's actually part of a filename is shown as two double-quote
characters in a row).  This change is intended to make it easier
for automated tools to parse the compiler's error message output,
by ensuring that filenames can be predictably parsed regardless of
any special characters that might appear within.

<li>The compiler now displays an initial status message indicating
the number of files it will need to build.  This is designed for
use by automated tools, to give them an estimate of the amount of
work to be done; this can be used, for example, to show a progress
bar indicator as the compilation proceeds.

<li>In the compiler options file (the .t3m file), certain options (-I,
-o, -Os, -FL, -FI, -Fs, -Fy, -Fo, -source, -lib) can be specified
using URL-style notation, to ensure portability of the .t3m file
across different operating systems.  In the past, the compiler didn't
properly translate these options to local conventions when they
contained '/' characters to separate path elements.  The compiler
now properly converts URL-style paths to local conventions.

<li>When an object is defined with an undefined or invalid superclass
name, and the object definition uses a template to define property
values, the compiler now reports an "undefined superclass" error
rather than an error with the template format.  In cases where a
superclass name is merely misspelled, the compiler will naturally
fail to find a matching template for the object, since the misspelled
superclass name probably doesn't have any templates associated with
it; thus, the template error is secondary to the true problem, which
is the misspelled superclass name.  This change should make the
diagnostics more useful by reporting the true problem rather than the
missing-template side effect.

<li>Text Grid windows no longer consolidate runs of whitespace;
instead, all whitespace written to a text grid window is treated
literally.

<li>Text Grid windows incorrectly interpreted HTML markups in the
text-only interpreters.  This has been corrected; text displayed to
text grids is now treated literally on all interpreters.

<li>Workbench now automatically saves the project (.t3m) file settings
upon starting execution of the game in the debugger, and also saves
the recent game order whenever a new game is loaded.  These measures
help reduce the chance of data loss in the event that Workbench
crashes while the game is running (which it ideally <i>should</i>
never do at all, but until the glorious day when it's perfectly
bug-free, this extra saving will at least make crashes a little less
painful).

<li>Due to a bug, Workbench on Windows did not start up correctly
when it was started by double-clicking on a .t3m file from the
Windows desktop.  (Workbench started with a blank interpreter
window, but didn't show the main Workbench IDE window at all.)
This has been corrected.

<li>A bug in the debugger caused the debugger to crash under certain
obscure circumstances.  In particular, the crash occurred if the game
caused a stack overflow, and the overflow happened to occur on a
recursive VM invocation from an intrinsic method (such as when an
intrinsic class method invokes an anonymous function callback).  This
has been corrected.

<li>In the past, the compiler generated an output function call for
the intial empty portion of a double-quoted string of the form
"&lt;&lt;expr&gt;&gt;..." (in other words, a string with an embedded
expression immediately after the open quote).  The compiler no longer
generates this superfluous empty string output operation, slightly
reducing code size and execution time.

<li>The String intrinsic class failed to enforce the 64k length limit
for an individual string in some cases; exceeding the limit caused
problems ranging from corrupted string text to crashes.  This has
been corrected; the interpreter now throws a run-time exception
("string is too long") if creating a string (via concatenation, for
example) would exceed this limit.  The List intrinsic class is
likewise more assertive now about enforcing its 64k limit as well.

<li>The regular expression functions (rexMatch, rexSearch, rexReplace)
were capable of causing the interpreter to crash (with a system stack
overflow) when asked to match a pattern to an extremely long string.
The exact limits varied by platform according to the amount of system
stack space available; on Windows, the problem started occurring with
strings about 5,000 characters long, although the exact length was
also a function of the complexity of the regular expression pattern.
This has been corrected; the regular expression matcher no longer uses
a recursive algorithm, so its consumption of system stack space is now
fixed and small.  The matcher still consumes memory that scales
according to the length of the input string and the complexity of the
regular expression, since such memory consumption is inherent in the
task; but the memory consumed is no longer in the system stack, which
means among other things that the matcher can now recover gracefully
(by throwing an "out of memory" run-time exception) if it should
exhaust available memory while working.

<li>In the DOS/Windows version, the executable file bundler
(maketrx32) didn't look for the character map library file
(cmaplib.t3r) in the correct location; it looked in the directory
containing the original interpreter executable rather than the
"charmap" subdirectory of the interpreter directory; since the
installer puts cmaplib.t3r in the subdirectory, the bundler failed to
find the file and omitted it from the bundled executable.  The program
now looks in the "charmap" subdirectory.

<li>A bug caused the compiler to crash on certain types of syntax
errors.  If a long string (around 1,000 bytes or longer) was
misplaced in a few specific contexts, the error message generator
overflowed an internal buffer trying to include the text of the
string in the error message.  This should no longer occur.

<li>The compiler now flags an error if a grammar production defines
more than 65,535 alternatives.  This limit is imposed by the .t3 file
format for grammar rules, but it's undesirable to get anywhere close
to the limit because of performance cost.  It's possible to exceed
the limit with relatively concise grammar rule definitions, because
the compiler expands the permutations of rules defined with '|'
alternatives.  Grammar rules that contain complex sets of
permutations using '|' alternatives should generally be rewritten
using sub-productions, which will allow equally complex rules without
the overhead of expanding the permutations.

<li>In reflect.t, reflectionServices.valToSymbol() can now correctly
identify the reflectionServices object itself.  (Due to a bug, this
caused a run-time error in the past.)

<li class=last>In reflect.t, reflectionServices.valToSymbol(), looking up an unnamed
object now returns a string giving the superclass list of the object,
if the superclass names are available.  The format of the return value
is now '(obj:sc1,sc2)', where 'sc1' and 'sc2' are the names of the
superclasses (naturally, more or fewer superclass names will appear
according to the actual number of superclasses of the object).  The
string 'obj' is literally present.  If none of the superclasses have
names, then the traditional result, '(obj)', is returned.  If some
superclasses have names but others don't, then the full list will
be returned, with '(anonymous)' used for any unnamed superclass.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6g (4/12/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The new interpreter option -R lets you specify the root folder
for individual resources.  By default, the root resource folder is
the folder that contains the image (.t3) file.  If -R is specified,
then the interpreter will look for resources in the given folder when
they can't be found in the image file itself or in a resource bundle
file.  Note that this isn't a search list; only one -R option can be
in effect.

<li>Added a new method, isRoundTripMappable(), to the
<a href="sysman/charset.htm">CharacterSet intrinsic class</a>.  This new
method provides an easy way to determine if a set of characters
has an exact, one-to-one mapping in a given local character set.

<li>The compiler now warns when a grammar rule ends with an empty
alternative, or is completely empty.  Empty rules at the top level of
a grammar rule are uncommon, and it's easy to accidentally leave a '|'
at the end of a rule, especially while actively defining new rules.
To eliminate this new warning, you can use an empty pair of
parentheses, "()", to explicitly indicate an empty rule.  This warning
only applies to the outermost grouping level of a rule; empty rules
within parenthesized portions of rules are not flagged.

<li>Fixed a problem in the console formatter that caused command lines
read from a command input file to be copied into a script output file
twice.

<li>Fixed a problem in the Dictionary class that caused dynamic
vocabulary to be forgotten if you saved a game to a file, ended the
interpreter session, started a new interpreter session, restored the
file saved earlier, saved again to a second file, and then later
restored the second file.  (The problem was that the Dictionary object
was not being marked as being in need of being saved again after it
was restored in the new session, so the second save didn't include the
dynamic vocabulary entries.  The Dictionary object is now properly
marked as being in need of saving after being restored.)

<li>Fixed a problem that caused the Object.propDefined() method
to yield incorrect results when called on an intrinsic class object
to retrieve information on methods added to the intrinsic class
with 'modify'.  The information returned was inconsistent with
that returned from getPropList().  This has been corrected;
the returned information should now be fully consistent.

<li>Fixed a problem that caused sporadic crashes in the Windows
debugger when an expression including the '&amp;' operator applied
to an undefined symbol was evaluated interactively.  This crashiness
should no longer occur.

<li>Fixed two problems in the text-only interpreters relating to
"&amp;" entities.  First, a few valid entity names were not
recognized at all, causing the interpreter to show the entity
source text (i.e., the "&amp;" code itself).  Second, entities
whose names weren't properly terminated (with a semicolon, ";")
had the last letter of their name incorrectly added to the display
after the entity itself.  These problems have been corrected.

<li>Fixed a couple of bugs that caused interpreter crashes when
running with "unicodeb" or "unicodel" character set mappings.

<li class=last>The versions of the interpreters that run in a Windows command
prompt window now correctly remove the console window's scrollbars in
all cases on Windows NT, 2000, and XP.  In the past, the interpreters
<i>usually</i> did this, but in some cases missed the scrollbars and
left them intact.  (Console scrollbars appear when the console
properties are set so that the console has a "screen buffer" larger
than the actual console window.  This feature isn't available on the
Windows 9x platforms, only on the NT branch, which includes 2000 and
XP.)  Leaving the scrollbars active created the confusing situation
that the area of the console containing the interpreter window could
be scrolled off the screen.  The scrollbars are now correctly removed
under all conditions.  This affects t3run.exe and tr32.exe.


</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6f (3/23/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem in the regular expression parser that misinterpreted
character class expressions involving single Unicode characters outside
of the plain ASCII range (for example: '&lt;\u2019|\u201D&gt;').  The
regular expression compiler treated such expressions as invalid; it
now handles them correctly.

<li>Added a couple of new compiler options to allow more control over
special system paths:

<ul>
  <li><tt>-FI <i>path</i></tt>: overrides the standard system include
directory with the given path.  The compiler normally uses a path that
depends on the operating system and installation configuration.  Note
that this option doesn't set up a search list the way -I does; there's
only a single system include directory in effect at any given time.

<li class=last>i><tt>-FL <i>path</i></tt>: overrides the standard system library
source directory with the given path.  The standard library path depends
on the operating system and installation configuration.  As with -FI,
there's only a single system library directory in effect at one time.
</ul>

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6e (3/16/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>A new HTML tag is now recognized: &lt;NOLOG&gt;.  This is a
container tag (so each &lt;NOLOG&gt; must have a corresponding
&lt;/NOLOG&gt; tag); it delimits text that is to be displayed only
on the interactive console, not in any log file (transcript) being
made.  The tag has no effect on the display.

<li>The getPropList() method previously only returned static methods
when called on intrinsic class objects (such as TadsObject or
BigNumber).  This has been changed so that the method now returns both
static and non-static methods.  This change clarifies the meaning of
getPropList() when called on an intrinsic class object: the method
returns the full set of properties that the class defines for
<b>instances</b> of the intrinsic class, which may not necessarily be
methods that are meaningful when called on the intrinsic class object
itself.  This change is necessary for consistency throughout the
class hierarchy for the reflection mechanism, so that a program can
traverse a class tree to create an exhaustive list of properties on
a class, including those inherited from intrinsic superclasses.

<li>In the output formatter, the effects of the "\^" and "\v"
sequences are now limited to the plain text outside of HTML markups.
In the past, if an HTML tag or entity appeared after a "\^" or "\v"
sequence and before any alphabetic character, the case conversion
effect was applied to the first character of the tag or entity name.
Entity names are case-sensitive, so this had the potential to
invalidate an entity name; in addition, whether a tag or entity name
interceded, the case conversion effect was effectively lost, since it
was misapplied to the HTML markup.  Now, with this output formatter
change, the case conversion effect of "\^" and "\v" sequences skips
past any HTML markups, so the case conversion is applied to the next
plain text.

<li>Fixed a problem in the console output formatter that caused
explicit blank line sequences to be ignored in some cases immediately
after reading input.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused spurious syntax errors in any
object definition that used a template in which a list element
followed a single-quoted string element.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused spurious syntax error reports
in certain cases involving multi-line strings as macro arguments.
If code involving a macro spanned multiple lines, and the macro
arguments included a string spanning multiple lines, and the string
was part of a larger expression that started with a non-string token,
the compiler sometimes misinterpreted the string as ending before its
actual terminating quote.  This resulted in spurious syntax errors,
as the compiler thought some of the string's continuation lines were 
non-string tokens.  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>Fixed a bug in the console output formatter that allowed too many
lines to be displayed between "MORE" prompts in some cases, which
caused text to scroll off the top of the screen before the player
could read it.  (The problem was introduced with the typographical
spaces in 3.0.6b.)

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6d (2/23/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem that caused the debugger to crash when attempting
to stop a running game when the game was suspended in the debugger at
a run-time exception that was thrown from within a callback invoked
from a system intrinsic method (for example, from a callback
invoked by the List.forEach() method).  This has been corrected.

<li>The inputKey() intrinsic function didn't return the correct
square-bracket code for special keys (arrow keys, function keys, and
so on) due to a bug introduced in an earlier patch release (3.0.6a).
This is now fixed.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in several methods of the Dictionary intrinsic
class (addWord, removeWord, forEachWord) that sometimes caused stack
overflows when calling these methods.  Fixed the same problem in some
File methods (setCharacterSet, closeFile, setPos, setPosEnd).

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6c (2/1/2003)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Defining a template for an object class no longer creates an
external reference to the object, so it's now legal to define
templates for objects that are never defined in any of the
modules linked into a program.  In the past, merely defining a
template for an object created a reference to the object.  This
change makes it easier to create more modular subsystems whose
components can be linked a la carte, since templates included in
a header for the subsystem won't by themselves drag in the modules
where the template objects are defined.  An object mentioned in
a template will now be required at link time only if the template
is actually used to create instances of the mentioned object.

<li>The 'modify grammar' statement now accepts an empty grammar rule
list to indicate that the rules defined in the base grammar
definition are to be retained.  This change makes it possible to
modify the properties and/or methods of a grammar rule in isolation,
without changing the syntax for the rule.  In the past, to modify
only properties or methods of a grammar rule, it was necessary to
repeat the entire rule list from the base grammar definition, since
the rule list in the 'modify grammar' statement always superseded the
base object's rule list.

<li>The firstObj/nextObj object iteration functions now filter out
"intrinsic class modifier" objects.  These are purely internal
implementation objects in the VM; they serve as the repositories of
properties and methods attached via the "modify" keyword to intrinsic
classes, and are for all intents and purposes parts of the intrinsic
classes they modify.  There is no benefit in enumerating them as
separate objects, and doing so created some confusing special cases
for code using the reflection mechanisms, so they've been eliminated
from the firstObj/nextObj results.

<li>The "intrinsic class" declaration syntax now allows the superclass
of the intrinsic class to be specified.  This information is largely
for documentary purposes; intrinsic classes are built into the VM, so
the "intrinsic class" syntax doesn't actually define intrinsic classes
but merely tells the compiler about the interfaces of the intrinsic
classes being used.  The system header files have been changed to take
advantage of this new feature to provide superclass information for
the intrinsic classes they declare.  The one immediate effect of this
change is that the compiler is now able to enforce the rule against
using "modify" with intrinsic methods of intrinsic classes, and can
do so for the entire inheritance tree; in the past, the compiler was
unable to enforce this rule for inherited intrinsic methods, since it
didn't have information on the inheritance relationships among
intrinsic classes.

<li>Workbench for Windows had a problem that, under certain
circumstances, caused the same directory to be added to the "include"
path in the build settings every time a project was opened.  This
happened when a file in the "include files" section of the project
had a parent-relative path (a path starting with "..").  This should
no longer occur.

<li>Workbench for Windows had a problem that failed to recognize the
library-relative path of a header file associated with a nested
library (that is, a library referenced from within another library;
for example, en_us.tl is nested within adv3.tl in the standard library
configuration).  This sometimes caused such header files to be listed
in the "include files" section of the project window with absolute or
parent-relative paths, when they should have been listed without any
path prefix, since Workbench automatically looks for header files in
the directories associated with libraries included in the build.
The unnecessary path prefixes caused other undesirable side effects,
such as including superfluous include paths in the build settings.
Workbench should now correctly identify headers associated with nested
libraries.

<li>Workbench for Windows did not properly initialize the "recent
projects" menu when configured to load the most recent game at
startup.  On the initial load at startup, the list of recent projects
was always shown with full, absolute directory paths, rather than with
paths relative to the initially loaded project's directory.  (This was
purely cosmetic, but was inconsistent, since the recent projects were
always shown with paths relative to the active project after opening
another project subsequently.)  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>A problem in the command-line option parser prevented some
combined TADS 2/3 interpreters from accepting the "-cs" (character
set) option for TADS 3 games.  This is now fixed.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6b (12/15/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>This version substantially overhauls the output formatter's
word-wrapping rules.  The changes are designed to give the game much
greater control over the way that text lines are wrapped to fit the
available horizontal space.  The changes should be relatively
transparent to existing code, because the new features mostly add
optional new controls, but use defaults that provide roughly the old
TADS 2 behavior.  The changes are implemented in both the text-only
and HTML interpreters.  The new text-wrapping rules are described in
detail in the <a href="sysman/fmt.htm">Formatting</a> documentation, but
here's a summary of the changes:

<ul>

  <li>The game can switch at any between "word-wrap" and "character-wrap"
  modes.  In word-wrap mode, text can be broken only at word boundaries;
  in character-wrap mode, text can be broken between almost any two
  characters.  The modes are selected with the new tag &lt;WRAP&gt;:
  &lt;WRAP WORD&gt; sets word-wrap mode, and &lt;WRAP CHAR&gt;
  sets character-wrap mode.

  <li>The formatter recognizes the Unicode character \uFEFF (HTML
  entity "&amp;zwnbsp;"), the zero-width non-breaking space.  This character
  doesn't show up on the display, but it tells the formatter not to break
  the line between the two adjacent characters, even if the text-wrapping
  rules would otherwise permit it.

  <li>The formatter recognizes the Unicode character \u200B
  ("&amp;zwsp;"), the zero-width space.  This character doesn't show
  up on the display, but it tells the formatter that it can break the
  line between the two adjacent characters, even if the wrapping rules
  wouldn't ordinarily allow a line break there.

  <li>The formatter recognizes several of the Unicode special-width
  space characters (en space, em space, etc).  All of these are treated
  as quoted space, in that they don't combine with adjacent runs of
  ordinary whitespace.  These spaces allow finer control over visual
  spacing, which facilitates a more typographical appearance in the
  HTML interpreters.

  <li>The "soft hyphen" character, \u00AD (HTML "&amp;shy;") is now
  accepted by the formatter.  This is invisible in most cases, but
  it tells the formatter that it can break the line by hyphenating.
  If the formatter does break a line at a soft hyphen, it displays
  the soft hyphen as an ordinary visible hyphen.

</ul>

<li class=last>Added the new "log file console."  This is a special kind of
console object that has no display, but simply captures all of its
output to a log file.  This can be used to capture game output to a
file, using the standard output formatting (including HTML
interpretation and word wrapping), without displaying anything to the
player.  Refer to the <a href="sysman/tadsio.htm">tads-io function set
documentation</a> for details.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.6a (11/23/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The new <tt>#pragma newline_spacing(on|off)</tt> directive lets
the program control the treatment of newlines in strings.  By default,
newline spacing is set to "on": when a newline character is found within
a string, the compiler converts the newline plus any whitespace that
immediately follows to a single space character.  When newline spacing
is set to "off", the compiler instead simply strips out the newline
and any immediately following whitespace.  Setting newline spacing
to "off" is desirable in some languages, such as Chinese, where
whitespace isn't conventionally used as a token separator in
ordinary text; turning off newline spacing can make it easier to
write code in these cases, because it allows strings to be split over
several lines without introducing unwanted whitespace.

<li>The compiler now allows macro substitutions in library (.tl) files.
In a library file, the value of a preprocessor symbol defined with the
-D option can be substituted into the text of the library file using
the notation "$(VARNAME)": the variable name is enclosed in parentheses
preceded by a dollar sign.  The adv3 library (adv3.tl) uses this
capability to parameterize the language-specific library and message
file selection.  See <a href="sysman/build.htm">Compiling and Linking</a>
for more information.

<li>The text-only interpreters now treat "&amp;nbsp;" as a true non-breaking
space.  (In the past, "&amp;nbsp;" was treated the same as "\ ", the
quoted space: the formatter did not combine such a space with other
adjacent whitespace, or remove it from the start of a line, but <i>did</i>
allow a line break to occur at an "&amp;nbsp;" character.)

<li>On Workbench for Windows, the Build Settings dialog has a new page
that lets you set the directory paths to use for object files and symbol
files.  This new page's tab is labeled "Temp Files," as the symbol and
object files are intermediate files that the compiler produces and
reads during compilation.  (These settings correspond to the -Fy and -Fs
compiler options.)

<li>When Workbench for Windows creates a new project, it automatically
creates a subfolder (of the folder containing the project file) to
store the project's object and symbol files.  The new subfolder is
called "obj".  Workbench initializes the new project's object file and
source file path options to the new subfolder.  The purpose of using
the subfolder is to keep the compiler-generated intermediate
files separate from the project's source files, to make it easier to
manage the files associated with the project.

<li>A portability bug that caused interpreter crashes on some platforms
(notably Solaris) has been fixed.  (This bug only occurred when the
interpreter was compiled with certain C++ compilers, and prevented
the interpreter from running any games.)

<li>The 'inherited' operator did not work properly to inherit a
modified intrinsic class method from the intrinsic base class of a
modified intrinsic class.  For example, if a method defined with
"modify TadsObject" used 'inherited' to inherit, and a method of the
same name was defined with "modify Object", the Object modifier method
was not properly inherited.  This has been corrected.

<li>The new compiler option "-errnum" causes the compiler to display
the numeric error code for each warning or error message.  By default,
the compiler does not display the numeric codes for errors, because
the code is mostly for the compiler's own use; however, the new option
allows the user to show these codes if desired, for purposes such as
cross-referencing with documentation.

<li>The new compiler option "-w-<i>nnn</i>" causes the compiler to
suppress the warning message identified by <i>nnn</i>, which is the
compiler's internal numeric code for the warning.  When this option is
used, the compiler will not display any warnings of the given type,
and will not include any such warnings in its summary error count.
This option can be repeated to suppress multiple types of warning
messages.  Only warnings (and pedantic warnings) can be disabled with
this option; specifying codes for errors of severity greater than
warnings will have no effect.  The complementary option
"-w+<i>nnn</i>" can be used to explicitly enable a warning; by
default, all warnings are enabled, so the only reason this option
would be needed is to enable a warning previously removed with
"-w-<i>nnn</i>" on the same command line, which might sometimes be
useful with shell aliases or command scripts.  Note also that the
"-w+<i>nnn</i>" option <b>cannot</b> be used to selectively enable
certain pedantic warnings without enabling pedantic mode; pedantic
warnings are an entirely separate class of messages from regular
warning, and can only be enabled as a group using the "-w2" option.
Once pedantic warnings are generally enabled, you can use
"-w-<i>nnn</i>" to disable specific pedantic warnings you wish to
suppress.  + <li>When searching for an external resource file (.3r0,
.3r1, etc.), the interpreter now looks for a file with both a
lower-case and upper-case version of each suffix.  This is intended to
make the naming convention more flexible on case-sensitive file
systems, such as Unix; on systems with case-insensitive file naming,
such as Windows or Mac, this change has no effect.

<li>Added support for mixed multi-byte character sets to the character
mapper; this allows the compiler to read source files encoded in
multi-byte character sets, and allows the interpreters to use local
system character sets with multi-byte encodings, both for displaying
text on the screen and reading text from the keyboard.  A number of
widely-used character sets for Asian languages use this type of
character set (Windows systems localized for Chinese and Japanese use
multi-byte character sets, for example).  Such character sets have
always been supported in the character map compiler (mkchrtab), but
the character mapper used in the compiler and VM did not implement the
mapping logic for these types of character sets.  Double-byte
character sets are now fully supported; the character mapper can now
handle any character set that uses two-byte sequences for all of its
characters (usually called double-byte character sets), or that uses a
mixture of one-byte and two-byte sequences (usually known as
multi-byte or mixed-multi-byte character sets).

<li>In Workbench for Windows, the Debug Log window displayed its
contents using the same color settings as in the main game window.
The Debug Log window now uses the color settings from the Workbench
"options" dialog, the same as source file windows.

<li>In the Build Settings dialog in Workbench for Windows, on the
Installer page, a new field allows overriding the default character
mapping library (cmaplib.t3r) with a custom mapping library.  This
is especially useful for authors working in Asian languages; the
default character map library includes mappings for the common
character sets for most European languages, but does not include
the Asian character sets because of the large size of these sets.
Authors working in languages which require character sets not included
in the default mapping library can create their own mapping file or
files (see the <a href="sysman/charmap.htm">character mapping documentation</a>),
then bundle the file(s) into a custom library (a .t3r file) using
the <tt>t3res</tt> tool.  Specify this .t3r file in the new
Character Map Library field, and the installer will automatically
bundle this file into your game's executable file when building
the install set.

<li>Fixed a problem in Workbench for Windows that caused Workbench to
reload a library (.tl) file every time Workbench became the foreground
application (i.e., its main window was activated after another
application had been in the foreground), if the library was ever
modified after being loaded in Workbench in that session.

<li>Fixed a problem in the UTF-8 character mapper that could have
caused problems in rare cases when reading from a text file encoded
in UTF-8.  The mapper did not correctly figure the byte length of the last
character when reading a three-byte character at the end of the buffer and
the first two of the three bytes was read into the buffer.  (This problem
was extremely unlikely to actually occur in practice, but in any case it's
now fixed.)

<li>Fixed a problem in the GrammarProd class that caused interpreter
crashes under certain circumstances.  In particular, if a grammar rule
was matched with a '*' element in the rule, and the matched input string
had exactly six tokens, an internal memory corruption led to an interpreter
crash.  This has been corrected.

<li>Fixed the t3make error message "error creating image file" to properly
show the image file name as part of the message.  This message incorrectly
showed the filename as "s", regardless of the actual name of the image.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the DOS character-mode interpreters (t3run and
tr32) that caused start-up error messages (in particular, errors
relating to loading the .t3 file, such as a "game file not found"
error) to be cleared from the display before the user had a chance to
see them.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5 (09/22/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The &lt;BANNER&gt; tag is no longer allowed for T3 HTML programs.
T3 games should use the banner API instead.  (The &lt;BANNER&gt;
tag has been removed entirely because it interacts poorly with
the banner API.  The adv3 library uses the banner API for the
status line, so this essentially forces programs using the library
to do likewise.  To reduce the potential for any confusion that
could result from games inadvertantly mixing banner API calls and
banner tags, we simply disallow banner tags entirely, to ensure
that all T3 programs use the banner API uniformly.)  For the moment,
&lt;BANNER&gt; tags are actually disallowed only when the banner API
is supported by an HTML interpreter; for HTML interpreters that don't
yet support the banner API, the tags are still allowed.  This support
will be withdrawn soon, though; we're just waiting until we're sure
that banner API support is available on all HTML interpreters.

<li>The compiler now assumes that each filename and folder name
specified in a ".t3m" file (a compiler makefile) is given relative to
the folder location of the .t3m file itself.  This makes the compiler
essentially independent of the working directory when using a .t3m
file, because the location of the .t3m file effectively becomes the
working directory for any file and folder paths specified within.
This treatment naturally does not apply to any filename given in a
.t3m file with an absolute path (for example, a Unix path that starts
with "/", an MS-DOS path that starts with "\" or a drive letter, or a
Macintosh path that starts with a volume name), since an absolute path
is already independent of the working directory.

<li class=last>The compiler now keeps information on the compiler version that
was used to compile a module.  The compiler checks this information
and automatically rebuilds a module that was built by an older version
of the compiler.  This ensures that all components of a program are
rebuilt whenever a new version of the compiler is installed.  (In the
past, the compiler did not consider itself to be a dependency of the
derived files, which occasionally led to confusing link-time errors
caused by mismatched object file information.)

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5h (09/14/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Some slight additional performance optimizations in the VM should
improve execution speed by another 10% or so (vs. release 3.0.5g).

<li>Fixed a problem in the Dictionary class that caused spurious
run-time error when restoring games (particularly when restoring
after a RESTART operation had been previously performed).

<li>Fixed a problem in the regular expression parser: the
counted-repeat operator ({n,m}) did not nest properly with closures.

<li>Fixed a debugger problem that caused the debugger to fail to
take control (i.e., pause the game program and enter the debugger UI)
when a run-time error occurred under certain conditions when using
the "Step Out" or "Step Over" commands.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the console-based text-only interpreters that
caused the [More] prompt to be displayed at the wrong place (at the
end of a line of text, rather than at the beginning) under certain
rare conditions.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5g (09/08/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="sysman/dict.htm">Dictionary</a> intrinsic class has been
substantially altered.  The central change is that the caller can now
specify a "comparator" object that defines how strings in the
dictionary are compared to input strings; this allows the game to
customize the rules for looking up dictionary words.  Related to this,
all methods related to truncation length have been removed; instead,
truncation, if desired, is now handled through the comparator.
Finally, the methods that look up words in the dictionary (findWord
and isWordDefined) have changed slightly to provide additional
information from the comparator about how an input word matches a
dictionary word.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/strcomp.htm">StringComparator</a> intrinsic
class.  This class works with the <a href="sysman/dict.htm">Dictionary</a>
intrinsic class to specify customized rules for matching input words
to dictionary words.  StringComparator provides options that specify
whether or not upper- and lower-case letters are distinguished;
whether words can be truncated (abbreviated) on input, and to what
minimum length; and a set of equivalence mappings that allow
alternative spellings on input, such as using unaccented equivalents
of accented characters.

<li class=last>The <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">GrammarProd</a> intrinsic class method
parseTokens() now uses the supplied Dictionary to perform comparisons
to literal tokens.  Each input token is compared to literal tokens in
the grammar rules using the Dictionary's current comparator.  Literal
tokens in grammar rules thus are matched using the same rules as
dictionary words.  The matchValues() results are stored in the
match tree objects in the new property tokenMatchList: this property
is set in each object in the match tree, and contains a list of
the matchValues() results corresponding to the token list elements.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5f (09/02/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added the new method findReplace() to the <a
href="sysman/string.htm">String</a> intrinsic class.  This new method is
similar to the <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm">rexReplace()</a>
function, but is slightly more efficient for situations where the text
to be replaced is a simple constant string rather than a regular
expression pattern.  It's also slightly simpler to use, since it's not
necessary to worry about any special regular expression interpretation
of the search string.

<li class=last>Added the new intrinsic class <a
href="sysman/rexpat.htm">RexPattern</a>.  This new class encapsulates a
"compiled" regular expression pattern, which can be used in place of a
pattern string in the regular expression functions.  Compiling an
expression converts it from a string into an internal representation.
When a particular pattern is used repeatedly in many searches, it's
much more efficient to use a RexPattern object to conduct searches
with the pattern, because the regular expression functions have to
compile their search patterns internally anyway; by using a
RexPattern, you perform the compilation for a particular pattern only
once, in advance, rather than each time you use the pattern.
Compilation takes a non-trivial amount of time, so if a pattern is
used frequently, pre-compiling it to a RexPattern can make a
difference in execution performance.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5e (08/25/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>This release has a number of VM, compiler, and intrinsic class
changes intended to make programs run faster.  The compiler now
generates more optimized code (especially when compiling with no debug
information), and VM executes code faster.  The changes should be
entirely transparent in terms of functionality, although a few new
VM instructions have been added, so code compiled with this new
version of the compiler will not run with older VM versions.

<li>Added two new <a href="sysman/lookup.htm">LookupTable</a> methods:
keysToList(), which returns a list consisting of all of the keys
in the table; and valsToList(), which returns a list consisting of
all of the values in the table.  In both cases, the lists are in
arbitrary order.

<li>The compiler left out a final newline after the error/warning
count summary at the end of a compilation that generated error or
warning messages.  This is now fixed.

<li>Fixed a couple of dialog messages in Workbench for Windows that
referred to ".t3x" files (the old version of the ".t3" extension).

<li>Fixed a problem in Workbench for Windows that caused an
unparseable compiler command line to be generated if an option
argument (such as an Include path) ended with a backslash.  The
problem had to do with DOS's odd command-line quoting rules; the
trailing backslash was treated as "quoting" the quote mark at the end
of the option argument.  This has been corrected.

<li>The compiler's command line error diagnostics are now somewhat
improved, to help pinpoint the source of an error.  In the past, the
compiler always simply showed its usage message if the command line had
a problem, which didn't help much in identifying which argument was
causing the problem.  The compiler now shows the usage message only
when the command line is empty (or when the argument "-help" is given);
in case of error, the compiler now shows a message explaining the
specific problem, and shows the particular option causing the problem
if appropriate.

<li class=last>In Workbench for Windows, the folder selector dialog was started
with an empty current folder, which made the entire dialog appear
empty, in some cases (such as when adding a directory to the "Include"
list in the Build Settings dialog).  The dialog should now always
start with a valid initial directory.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5d (08/04/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Workbench for Windows now has a primitive but usable "profiling"
feature.  Profiling is a technique in which the programmer collects
data on where the running program is spending its time.  The purpose
is to identify any areas where the program spends a disproportionate
amount of time; this sometimes reveals obvious bottlenecks where the
code can be sped up with simple improvements, and in any case usually
reveals the areas where optimization efforts will yield the greatest
results.  Workbench collects profiling data with function/method
granularity: each time the program enters or exits a function or
method, Workbench can track the time spent in that code.  The user can
turn profiling on and off using the new "Profiler" menu; when
profiling is turned on, Workbench collects profiling data until the
profiler is turned off, at which point the system asks for a file to
which to write the collected data.  Workbench writes the data as a
tab-delimited text file: the first column is the name of the function
or method; the second is the number of microseconds spent
<b>directly</b> in that code; the third is the number of microseconds
spent in functions or methods <b>called by</b> that code (which
excludes the time spent directly in the code itself); and the fourth
is the number of times the function or method was invoked.  This
format can be easily loaded into an external analysis tool (such as a
spreadsheet application) for inspection.  (The profiling facility is
designed mostly for use by library authors, so we probably won't
go to great lengths in the area of ease of use; and we don't expect
to build any integrated analysis tools, as a spreadsheet is more
than adequate to analyze the data.)

<li>Fixed some problems in the DOS interpreter's display management
(these are generic character-mode interpreter fixes that will also
take care of the same problems on Unix and other character-mode
systems).  The problems affected resizing the terminal window,
interaction with "More" prompts in some situations, and cursor
placement under certain conditions.  In addition, the "review mode"
status bar is back (it was missing from the first versions with the
banner API); note, though, that the mode bar is now displayed at the
top of the main game window rather than taking over the status line,
which is necessary because of the possibility the banner API creates
of non-standard status line layouts.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the VM that could conceivably have caused
crashes or other misbehavior under certain extremely improbable
conditions involving stack overflows.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5c (07/28/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>The banner creation function bannerCreate() has a slightly modified
interface.  The new interface allows the initial size of the banner to
be set in terms of the natural sizing units of the window; in addition,
percentage-based sizing is still possible as well.

<li>Percentage-based banner sizing now behaves slightly differently
than it used to.  In the past, the percentage size was based on the size
of the complete application window.  The percentage size is now based
instead on the "remaining space" at the point at which a banner is
laid out during the screen layout process.

<li class=last>The new banner function bannerSetSize() complements
bannerSizeToContents() by adding the ability to set a banner's
size in terms of the natural sizing units of the window or a new
percentage-based size.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5b (07/20/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last>Fixed a bug in the interpreter that caused sporadic crashes in
situations involving adding lots of new properties to an object (of
class TadsObject).

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3.0.5a (07/14/2002)</h3>

<ul>

<li>A new set of functions, collectively called the
<a href="sysman/banners.htm">banner API</a>, provides more direct programmatic
control over the appearance of the user interface than was available
in past versions of TADS.  The new API allows the program to divide
the display into multiple "banners," which are non-overlapping windows,
each with its own independent output stream.  The banner API provides
functionality based on the HTML TADS &lt;BANNER&gt; tag, but offers
more power, and is also supported on many text-only interpreters.

<li>Any time a nested object is defined, the compiler now automatically
defines the property <tt>lexicalParent</tt> in the nested object, setting
the property to a reference to the lexically enclosing object.

<li>The main text window's output stream is now <b>always</b> in HTML mode.
The "\{" and "\}" sequences have likewise been removed, since these
are no longer useful now that HTML mode cannot be switched on and off.

<li>The "\H+" and "\H-" output control sequences have been removed.
These are no longer useful now that HTML mode switching has been removed.

<li>The "\(" and "\)" output control sequences have been removed.
The HTML markups &lt;B&gt; and &lt;/B&gt; should be used instead.
The "\(" and "\)" sequences are now redundant with the HTML &lt;B&gt;
markup, since text output streams are now always in HTML mode.

<li>A new system information code, SysInfoInterpClass, retrieves
information on the broad "class" of the interpreter.  This returns
one of the following:

  <ul>
  <li>SysInfoIClassText: a text-only character-mode interpreter, such as
      MS-DOS TADS or Unix TADS.  This type of interpreter uses a single
      fixed-pitch font to show all text, cannot show any graphics, and
      uses the text-only HTML subset.
  <li>SysInfoIClassTextGUI: a text-only interpreter running on a graphical
      platform, such as MacTADS or WinTADS.  This type of interpreter
      might use proportionally-spaced fonts, and might use multiple fonts.
      These interpreters cannot show graphics using HTML, but they might
      use some graphics of their own for things like window borders.
      This type of interpreter recognizes the text-only HTML subset.
      Note that this code isn't indicative of the type of OS, but rather
      of the type of interpreter: MS-DOS TADS <b>always</b> returns
      SysInfoIClassText, even when it's running in a DOS box under
      Windows, because it still acts like a character-mode interpreter
      even when running on a Windows machine.
  <li>SysInfoIClassHTML: a full HTML interpreter, such as HTML TADS on
      Windows, or HyperTADS on Macintosh.
  </ul>

<li>The SysInfoHtml and SysInfoHtmlMode system information codes have
been eliminated.  The former is superseded by SysInfoInterpClass, and
the latter has been rendered obsolete by the elimination of HTML mode
switching.

<li>The TADS 3 character-mode interpreters now support the &lt;TAB&gt;
tag, if the underlying OS code allows.  This tag is supported on all
full HTML interpreters, plus most character-mode text-only platforms.
The GUI text-only interpreters do not support this currently.  The
full complement of &lt;TAB&gt; features is supported; see the HTML TADS
documentation (specifically, the TADS-specific markup extensions) for
details.

<li>The compiler and VM support "transient" objects, which are objects
that do not participate in any of the VM's built-in persistence
mechanisms (save, restore, undo, restart).  A transient object is
not saved to a saved state file, and isn't affected by restore, undo,
or restart operations.  This is described more fully in the
<a href="sysman/objdef.htm">Object Definitions</a> section of
the documentation.

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm">saveGame</a> function works
differently than it used to.  The function no longer saves the
execution context, so it no longer has the "setjmp" behavior.

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm">restoreGame</a> function
works differently as well.  Because saveGame no longer saves the
execution context, restoreGame no longer restores it, so the function
simply returns on successful completion - it doesn't have the
"longjmp" behavior any more.  This new design is much more flexible,
because it allows arbitrary session information to be retained
across the Restore operation, via local variables on the stack as
well as with transient objects, and gives the program complete
control over execution flow throughout the operation.

<li>The <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm">restartGame</a> function
also has a new design.  The function no longer requires a function
to jump to, but simply resets object state and returns.  As with the
restoreGame changes, this allows the program complete control over
execution flow and allows any amount of session information to
be retained across the Restart operation.

<li>All instances of the <a href="sysman/file.htm">File</a> intrinsic
class are now transient.  The static creation methods of the File
class always return transient objects.

<li>It is now possible to open "resources" as though they were files,
and read their data using the <a href="sysman/file.htm">File intrinsic
class</a>.  Two new static construction methods make this possible:
openTextResource() and openRawResource().

<li>The option flags for the String.htmlify() method have been renamed,
to make the names of the flags more descriptive of their functions.
The flags formerly were of the form HtmlifyKeepXxx, but now use names
of the form HtmlifyTranslateXxx.  The change of terms to "translate"
is a better match for what the flags actually mean, since the flags
specify that certain characters are to be translated into HTML markup
equivalents.

<li>In Workbench for Windows, when the status line is displayed, the
messages from the compiler showing the build progress are not displayed
to the debug log window, but rather to the status line.  This makes it
much easier to read the results in the log window, and especially makes
it easier to see the error messages, since the error messages aren't
mixed in with lots of build progress messages.  When the status line
is hidden, build progress messages are still shown in the log window
so that the compiler's progress can be seen.

<li>The internal character encoding that the T3 software was using
in past versions was not in conformance with the T3 specification, which
calls for the standard UTF-8 encoding.  The software was using an older
encoding that had been obsoleted in the spec but was never changed in
the software.  This has been corrected; note that this change requires
recompiling any existing games.

<li>Due to a bug, Workbench for Windows did not properly store directory
paths (such as for the Include path list) in the project file when the
paths included a colon (":") character.  This has been fixed.

<li>A bug in Workbench for Windows caused the Window menu to display
incorrect entries for Windows 95 and NT 4 (actually, this is more due
to a bug in Windows 95 and NT 4, but Workbench didn't work around the
bug, so in a sense it was a Workbench bug).  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>A compiler bug caused the compiler to crash (with an access
violation or equivalent) when given a source file whose very first
object definition started with a template containing a double-quoted
string with an embedded expression.  This problem is now fixed.

<h3>Changes for version 3.0.4 - 06/01/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem in the Vector intrinsic class that caused interpreter
crashes under certain circumstances.  (The exact conditions were not
entirely predictable, because the problem had to do with an interaction
between the Vector class, the garbage collector, and the undo mechanism,
and only occurred when garbage collection was triggered after certain
operations in the Vector class.)

<li>Added a status line to Workbench for Windows.  The status line is
optional; it can be displayed or hidden, as desired, using the "View" menu.
When displayed, the status line shows whether or not the program being
debugged is running, and shows the line and column number of the current
cursor position when a source file window is active.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in Workbench that prevented parts of the window
layout from being saved in the project configuration file when the
main Workbench application window was closed while the program being
debugged was still running.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 05/19/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>The DOS text-mode interpreter now supports setting text colors.
Text colors can be set through HTML, as follows:

<ul>
  <li>The &lt;FONT COLOR=xxx BGCOLOR=yyy&gt; tag can be used to set the 
  and background colors of the text.  The basic set of HTML colors is
  recognized, although
  the effective set of available colors is limited to the eight ANSI
  colors that DOS character mode can display: white, black, red, green,
  blue, yellow, cyan, and magenta.  Hex RGB values (for example,
  &lt;FONT COLOR='#C080E0'&gt; are accepted, but these are simply
  mapped to the nearest available color from the ANSI set.
  Note that if a FONT tag specifies both COLOR and BGCOLOR, the text
  will be displayed exactly as specified; if the FONT tag specifies
  only COLOR, then the background color will be inherited from the
  enclosing text, and ultimately from the &lt;BODY&gt; color if no
  enclosing text has a specific background color.

  <li>The &lt;BODY&gt; tag can be used to set the foreground and background
  color of the window.  The TEXT attribute sets the foreground text color,
  and the BGCOLOR attribute sets the background color of the window.
  The background color affects the entire window, just as in the
  HTML interpreters, so the entire window will be redisplayed in its
  new color whenever a &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=xxx&gt; tag is displayed.

  <li>The parameterized color names (TEXT, BGCOLOR, STATUSTEXT, STATUSBG)
  are accepted and map to the current settings of those colors, as set
  by the TRCOLOR program.
</ul>

<li>The new system information code SysInfoTextColors can be used to
determine the level of color support available on the platform.  The
return value is a code indicating the level of support:

<ul>
  <li>SysInfoTxcNone - no color support
  <li>SysInfoTxcParam - parameterized color names only
  <li>SysInfoTxcAnsiFg - The eight ANSI colors are available for text, but
     there is no capability to set the background color
  <li>SysInfoTxcAnsiFgBg - the ANSI colors are available for text and
     background colors (this is the code the DOS interpreter returns)
  <li>SysInfoTxcRGB - full RGB text color support is available (this is the
     code the Windows HTML interpreter returns)
</ul>

<li class=last>The new system information code SysInfoTextHilite can be used to
determine whether or not text highlighting is available.  This returns
true if a distinctive appearance for &lt;B&gt; text is available,
nil if not.  The HTML interpreters return true for this; the text-only
interpreters generally return true, unless running in "plain" ASCII
mode or with a terminal or display device that cannot render anything
special for highlighted text.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 05/05/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem in Workbench for Windows with libraries (.tl
files) found via the library search path.  In some cases, the files
within a library could not be opened; in addition, the library itself
was not always properly scanned on opening the project, so no files
within the library were visible in the Project window.  Libraries
found via the search path should work properly now.

<li>Workbench for Windows now uses small (8x8-pixel) icons in the left
margin of debugger source windows when the selected source window font
is smaller than the standard (16x16-pixel) icons.  (These are the icons
that show the location of the current line, breakpoints, and so on
during a debugging session.)  This allows more lines to be displayed
vertically in a source window when a small font is selected.

<li>When quitting out of Workbench, if a build is still running, the
Workbench displays a dialog indicating that Workbench is waiting for
the build to complete.  In the past, there was no way to force
Workbench to exit if the build process had become stuck.  Now, the
"waiting for build" dialog offers an "Abort" button; clicking this
button will forcibly terminate the build, allowing Workbench to
terminate immediately.  This button is useful when the build process
becomes stuck (which ideally should never happen, but has happened
at times due to compiler bugs).  The build process should not normally
be aborted forcibly unless the build appears stuck, because forcibly
terminating a process on Windows can occasionally cause Windows to
become unstable.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that made it possible for the linking step
to get stuck in an infinite loop if the data associated with a particular
"grammar" production became too large.  This should no longer occur.

<li>Fixed a debugger bug that caused sporadic crashes when running
games in Workbench.

<li class=last>Added new systemInfo() codes for MNG display:
  <ul>
    <li>SysInfoMng - can the system display MNG images?
    <li>SysInfoMngTrans - can the system display MNG's with transparency?
    <li>SysInfoMngAlpha - can the system display MNG's with alpha channels
       (i.e., partial transparency)?
  </ul>

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 04/28/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Renamed numerous macros in the system and adv3 header files to
achieve more consistency in the naming scheme.  Here's a table of
the changes.  (Sorry this isn't a Perl script or something.)

<li>Added Phil Lewis's new Adv3 Reference Help to Workbench for
Windows.  This new Windows Help file is a reference to the classes
in the adv3 library; Phil created it for his own use but has
graciously offered it for inclusion in the Author's Kit distribution.
Phil says the reference isn't complete, but it has a wealth of
information all the same.  The Adv3 Help can be reached from the
"TADS 3 Library" item on the Workbench "Help" menu.

<li>The compiler can now search for source files using a
user-specified list of directories.  This allows makefiles (.t3m
files) to specify source files using only relative filename paths,
eliminating any dependency in a makefile on the local system's
directory structure and thus allowing the project to be easily used on
other systems.  The compiler searches for its files by looking in the
following locations, in order:

<ul>
  <li>The current working directory (for Workbench users, this is the
      directory containing the .t3m file for the project).

  <li>The directories specified with "-Fs" compiler options, in the
      order of the options.

  <li>The directories specified with the new "user library" mechanism.

  <li>The "system library" directory.  This is the special directory
      containing the compiler's own libraries.  This directory varies
      by system, but it is normally set up automatically when TADS is
      installed and requires no user action to configure.
</ul>

The "user library" list is specified using a system-dependent
mechanism:

<ul>
  <li>For the DOS/Windows command-line compiler (i.e., run from a
      command prompt), set the environment variable TADSLIB
      to a list of directories, separated by semicolons (";").

  <li>For Workbench for Windows, enter the list of directories in
      the "Libraries" page of the Workbench preferences dialog,
      reachable from the "Options" item on the "View" menu.

  <li>The mechanisms for other systems are yet to be determined,
      but in all likelihood Unix will use the same TADSLIB
      environment variable as the DOS version.
</ul>

<li>Workbench for Windows has a new option to automatically load
the most recent project when Workbench is started.  To set the
start-up mode, use the "Start-Up" page of the Workbench preferences
dialog, reachable from the "Options" item on the "View" menu.

<li>Added the new systemInfo() code SysInfoOgg, which senses whether
or not the interpreter supports Ogg Vorbis audio playback.

<li>Changed <tt>inputEvent()</tt> so that it accepts a nil timeout
argument value, for consistency with <tt>inputLine()</tt>.  A nil
value for the timeout is equivalent to omitting the timeout argument
entirely: it indicates that the input should be allowed to proceed
indefinitely.

<li>The compiler now stores preprocessor symbol (macro) definitions
with the debugger records of the compiled program, when compiling
for source-level debugging (i.e., using the "-d" compiler command-line
option).  The debugger uses the preprocessor symbols when parsing
expressions during the debugging session, so it is now possible
to interactively evaluate expressions involving macros.  Note that
the compiler keeps debugging records for a macro only if the macro
(1) is never undefined (using #undef) or redefined with a different
expansion within a given module, and (2) has the exact same expansion
in every module in which it is defined; these restrictions mean that
only macros with consistent "global" meanings across the entire
program are visible in the debugger.

<li>Fixed a problem in Workbench for Windows that caused an incorrect
name to be stored for the game's initial source file when creating a
new project.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused the compiler to crash when
confronted with a constant index expression where the indexed value
was not a list (e.g., <tt>1[1]</tt>).

<li>Fixed a problem in the Windows HTML interpreter that prevented
interrupted command lines from continuing correctly.  When a command
line input was interrupted by a timeout, the command line that was
under construction when the timeout occurred was not properly restored
for further editing.  This has been corrected.

<li>Fixed a problem in the VM that caused the VM to crash under rare
circumstances.  The problem was particularly likely to occur when
stepping through large amounts of code with the debugger.

<li>Fixed a problem in the character map compiler (mkchrtab) that
generated corrupted character map files when the source file had
duplicated display mapping entries.

<li>The distributions (including the installer kits and the source
code distribution) now include a full set of character mapping files
that should cover most users on most platforms.  For a listing of
the included codings, see charmap/README.txt.  (The full set adds
only about 25k to the compressed distribution files, which seems a
small cost for the simplicity of having an essentially universal set
of mappings available with the default install.)

<li>The Windows Author's Kit installer now associates .t3m files with
Workbench, so that double-clicking on a .t3m file from Windows
Explorer will open the file in Workbench.  (The 4/7/2002 version still
set the association for .t3c files instead, despite Workbench's switch
to .t3c files for storing project configuration information.)

<li class=last>Fixed a problem that caused the compiler to display the incorrect
text for invalid tokens in certain error messages related to 'grammar'
statement syntax.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 04/07/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Workbench for Windows now uses the compiler makefile (.t3m) file
format to store its project information.  This means that a Workbench
project file can be used directly as a compiler makefile, using
the compiler's "-f" option.  For the moment, Workbench is still capable
of loading 

<li>Workbench on Windows now monitors for Ctrl+Break, and breaks into
the debugger when this key combination is detected.  This allows
easily breaking into the debugger if the .t3 program enters an
infinite loop.

<li>The 'replace' and 'modify' keywords can now be used to change
'grammar' definitions.  Refer to the <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">Grammar
Rules</a> documentation for details.

<li>A grammar production object can now be declared without creating
any rules associated with the production.  The new syntax is simply
"grammar <i>production_name</i>;" (that is, a "grammar" statement that
simply ends after the name of the production).  This can be useful for
libraries that want to define rules that refer to productions for
which the library itself provides no rules, so that games based on the
library can fill in the grammar definitions for the productions.  In
the past, if a production was referenced as a subproduction from one
or more rules but had no rules of its own defined, the linker
generated an error, because it is likely in such cases that the rules
referring to the undeclared production were misspelled and meant to
refer to a declared production; this new syntax gives the author a way
to tell the compiler explicitly that a production name was used
intentionally, even if the production has no rules.

<li>Added new syntax that allows multiple part-of-speech properties
(such as "noun" or "adjective") to be used as a single token matcher
in a grammar rule.  The new syntax uses a list of properties in
angle brackets: <tt>&lt;noun adjective plural&gt;</tt>.  When
this syntax is used, an input token matching any of the part-of-speech
properties in the list matches the rule token position.

<li>Moved the "build configuration" information that was formerly
stored in object (.t3o) files into the symbol (.t3s) files instead.
The compiler uses the build configuration data stored in these files
to determine if recompilation of a given source file is necessitated
by build configuration changes since the last time the file was
compiled.  In the past, when the information was stored in the object
files, the compiler unnecessarily regenerated symbol files repeatedly
when compilations failed due to syntax errors, because compilation
didn't get far enough to store the build data.  Moving the information
to the symbol files allows the compiler to skip symbol table
generation when a previous compilation generated a valid symbol file
for a given module.  This saves time in the build-edit-build cycle
when a program is initially compiled and contains syntax errors.

<li>Added two new pseudo-variable keywords: <tt>targetobj</tt> and
<tt>definingobj</tt>.  These pseudo-variables are similar to
<tt>self</tt> and <tt>targetobj</tt>, in that they act like
read-only variables (i.e., you cannot assign values to them), and
they are automatically maintained by the interpreter to keep track
of the current method context.  <tt>targetobj</tt> returns the "original
target object" of the current method; this is the object that was
targeted by the method call that reached the current method.  The
target object is set each time a method is called normally or via
<tt>delegated</tt>, and remains the same as methods are invoked
via <tt>inherited</tt>.  <tt>definingobj</tt> is the object that
defines the currently executing method; this is normally simply
the object where the method was actually defined in the program's
source code.

<li>Removed the <tt>getMethodDefiner()</tt> intrinsic function from
the "tads-gen" function set.  This function has been replaced by
the new pseudo-variable <tt>definingobj</tt>.

<li>Changed the interface of the Object.propInherited() intrinsic
class method.  The method now takes an additional argument (positionally
the second argument in the new interface) giving the original target
object of the call.  In cases where the caller wishes to know
if the currently active method can inherit a base class method, the
value for the new argument should simply be <tt>targetobj</tt>.

<li>Changed the way <tt>inherited</tt> behaves after
<tt>delegated</tt> is used.  In the past, the inheritance mechanism
tried to find the defining object of the method with the
<tt>inherited</tt> operator in the inheritance tree of "self".  After
<tt>delegated</tt>, the defining object is normally not related by
inheritance to "self", so the old search pattern normally failed to
find any inherited instance of the method.  Now, the interpreter keeps
track internally of the "original target" object in addition to the
"self" object; the original target is always the target of the last
explicit method call or the target of the most recent
<tt>delegated</tt> operator.  The <tt>inherited</tt> operator uses the
original target object as the starting point of the inheritance tree
search, rather than "self"; this allows <tt>inherited</tt> to find
methods inherited from base classes of the delegatee when appropriate.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused incorrect code to be generated
for statements like this: <tt>if (<i>constant_expr</i> &amp;&amp;
<i>non_constant_expr</i>)</tt> - that is, an "if" whose condition
expression consists of a constant expression (i.e., an expression
whose value can be determined at compile-time) and a non-constant
expression joined by the "&amp;&amp;" operator.  The code that the
compiler generated caused unpredictable results at run-time, and was
able to crash the interpreter in some cases.  This has been corrected.

<li>Increased the standard VM stack size to 4096 stack slots (from 1024).

<li>Expanded the compiler's maximum symbol length to 80 characters,
to accomodate the longer symbols generated by the new treatment of
production match object tagged names as actual compiler symbols.

<li>Fixed a problem that caused a sporadic interpreter crash when
using restartGame().  This crash occurred only rarely, and was related
to memory management during program re-initialization.  This should no
longer occur.

<li>Fixed a problem with restoreGame() that caused modifications to
intrinsic classes to be lost in some cases.  This problem occurred
rarely, and should no longer occur.

<li class=last>Changed the character mapping input file format slightly.  The
"unicode_to_local" keyword has been renamed to "display_mappings",
and has a slightly different effect: in the "display_mappings"
section, each character mapping gives the <b>Unicode</b> expansion
of a Unicode code point; that is, each mapping specifies a set of
Unicode characters to substitute for the Unicode character being
mapped.  The expansion is then further translated automatically by
the character mapper to the local character set.  Each expansion
<b>must</b> map to characters defined in the one-to-one mapping
section (i.e., the set of mappings before the "display_mappings"
keyword).  Note in particular that an expansion <b>cannot</b>
map to characters that are themselves further expanded.  The purpose
of this change is to allow the interpreter to perform expansion
mappings - that is, mappings that can translate one Unicode character
to several display characters - while still in the Unicode domain,
and hence to perform operations such as word-wrapping on the expansions.
The console output formatter uses this to properly word-wrap lines with
expanded display mappings.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 03/16/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed script-reading mode in the interpreter.  Past versions did
not correctly read input scripts (using the command-line interpreter's
"-i" option, for example).

<li>Added the new input event code INEVT_END_QUIET_SCRIPT, which is
described in the documentation for the
<a href="sysman/tadsio.htm">inputLineTimeout</a>
intrinsic function.

<li>Added a couple of small usabilty enhancements to Workbench for Windows:
  <ul>
  <li>Pushing the Return/Enter key when keyboard focus is in the Project
      window opens the selected module in a source file window, if a module
      is selected.  This allows easier keyboard navigation of the Project
      file list.
  <li>Double-clicking on a module in the Project window now moves keyboard
      focus to the newly-opened source file window.  In the past, focus
      stayed on the Project window, so context-sensitive commands (such
      as "Find") did not apply to the newly-opened source window until
      manually clicking on the window to activate it.
  </ul>

<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>mkchrtab</tt> (the character map compiler)
that caused incorrect mappings in some compiled mapping files having
display (from_unicode_to_local) mappings that expanded to more than
one byte.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the Windows interpreter that made it
incompatible with Windows 95.  The interpreter should once again be
compatible with Windows 95.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 03/10/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added the new method removeElement() to the <a href="sysman/vector.htm">
Vector intrinsic class</a>.  This new method removes an element by
value, modifying the vector in-place.

<li>Added the new method forEachWord() to the <a href="sysman/dict.htm">
Dictionary intrinsic class</a>.  This new method provides a way of
enumerating all of the entries in a Dictionary object.

<li>Added information to the LICENSE.TXT file making it clear that
derived versions of the library are permitted with few restrictions.

<li>The "!" operator can now take an object reference as its operand;
when applied to a non-nil object reference, "!" yields nil.  This
means that constructs such as "if (!obj)" are now treated as equivalent
to "if (obj == nil)"; such constructs formerly generated a run-time
error.  In addition, property ID's, single-quoted strings, lists,
and function pointers can all be used as operands of "!", and "!"
applied to any of these types yields nil.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused the compiler to crash in some
cases when confronted with an empty pair of parentheses within a
grammar rule, such as <tt>grammar myProd: ('mytoken' ())</tt>.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused the compiler to crash in some
cases when given a method definition with no code body and the end of
the object immediately following.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused incorrect code generation for
an 'if' with a constant controlling expression that evaluated to
true and no 'else' clause.  In such cases, the true branch of the
'if' was not generated; this has been corrected.

<li>The project file extension for Workbench for Windows is now
".t3c" (it was formerly ".tdc", the same as it was for the TADS 2
Workbench).  The extension has been changed to allow the Windows
desktop to launch the appropriate version of Workbench when the user
double-clicks a project file from the desktop and both TADS 2 and
ADS 3 Workbench versions are installed.

<li>Fixed a problem in the VM that caused repeated "terminate game"
dialogs to appear in Workbench for Windows when the user attempted
to compile the game after the debugger intercepted a run-time error.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the character map compiler (mkchrtab) that
caused invalid map files to be generated if the source file had more
than one symmetric (bidirectional) mapping assigned to the same
Unicode code point.  The character map compiler now generates a
warning when these collisions occur, and generates valid map files
even when collisions are present by ignoring redundant mappings.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 02/17/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>The compiler now shows a summary count of warnings and errors at
the end of the compiler console output when either count is non-zero,
to make it more obvious that messages were generated during the
compilation.  If many modules are included in a compilation, the
status messages that the compiler generates as it works through the
module list can make it easy to miss an error or warning mixed in
among all the status messages.  The new summary at the end of the
compilation should make it easier to notice when something requires
attention.  No summary counts are displayed when there are no warnings
or errors; this is intended to make it even easier to notice when
something is wrong, since authors will not be accustomed to seeing
a summary count at all when everything is well.

<li>The <a href="sysman/iter.htm">Iterator intrinsic class</a> has the new
methods getCurVal() and getCurKey(), which return the value and key
of the current element of the iteration, respectively.  For indexed
collections, the "key" is the index of the current element.

<li>LookupTable.forEach() no longer passes the key argument to the
callback.  If the key is desired, use the new method forEachAssoc()
instead.  This allows LookupTable to be used more interchangeably
with other Collection subclasses, since its forEach() method has the
same interface as the corresponding method of other Collection
subclasses.

<li>LookupTable, List, and Vector now have the additional method
forEachAssoc(func), which calls func(key,val) for each element of
the collection.  For List and Vector, the "key" is the index of
the element; for LookupTable, it is the key for the entry.

<li>The Array intrinsic class has been deleted; Vector should be used
instead.  The Array class was too similar to the Vector class to
justify its existence as a separate type, so the functionality of
Array and Vector are now combined into the single Vector class.

<li>When a Vector is used as the left-hand side of a '+' or '-'
operation, in the past, the VM modified the left-hand side Vector
object directly.  This has been changed so that a new Vector is
created, and the original left-hand Vector is left unchanged.  The
old behavior was confusing in that it gave the '+' and '-' operators
side effects, which is inconsistent with the behavior of the
operators in other situations.

<li>A new Vector method, appendAll(), allows appending the individual
elements of a List or Vector to another Vector in-place (i.e., without
creating a new Vector object, as the '+' operator does).

<li>The Vector methods getUnique() and subset() now return a new
Vector to store the result of the operation.  In the past, these
methods modified the original Vector in place.

<li>In the past, when a Vector was used as the right-hand side of a
'+' operator whose left-hand side was a List or Vector, the List or
Vector on the right was the single new element concatenated to the
left-hand collection.  This was inconsistent with the handling of
List values; a List value concatenates its elements individually when
used as the right-hand side of a '+' operator.  For consistency,
Vector now concatenates its elements individually when used on the
right side of a '+' operator.  Similarly, Vector values now subtract
their elements from the left-hand side collection when used as the
right-hand side of a '-' operator, also for consistency with the List
type's behavior.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the VM that caused the VM to lose track of
intrinsic class modifiers after a RESTORE operation.  Intrinsic
class modifiers will now properly survive RESTORE operations.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 02/09/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Changed <tt>inputLineTimeout</tt> so that it accepts a nil
timeout argument value.  A nil value for the timeout is equivalent to
omitting the timeout argument entirely: it indicates that the input
should be allowed to proceed indefinitely.

<li>Improved <tt>inputLineTimeout</tt>'s interaction with the OS
layer so that the portable code can handle complete non-implementation
of input-with-timeout by the OS layer.

<li>Changed <tt>getTime(GETTIME_TICKS)</tt> so that the function always
chooses the zero point of the system clock as the time of the first
call to the function.  This reduces the likelihood that a game will
encounter a roll-over of the system clock, which could lead to confusion
in interpreting time differences and the ordering of events.

<li>Changed the names of two methods in the LookupTable intrinsic
class.  The method formerly called countBuckets() is now
getBucketCount(), and the method formerly called countEntries() is
now getEntryCount().  These names match the names as given in the
documentation, but the header file (lookup.h) had the old names.

<li>Added the compiler option "-clean", which causes the compiler
to skip ordinary compilation and instead simply remove all derived
files that the compilation would have produced; in particular, this
removes the symbol (.t3s), object (.t3o), and image (.t3) files that
the compilation would have produced.

<li>Added the compiler option "-Pi", which causes the compiler to
skip ordinary compilation and instead write to the standard output a
list of files included with <tt>#include</tt> directives throughout
the program.  The compiler runs the normal preprocessing, and shows
only files included in conditional compilation sections that are
selected in the compilation (in other words, the list does not
include any files included from within the false branches of
<tt>#if</tt> or other conditional compilation directives).  In the
generated list, the files are listed one file per line, and each line
specifying a file consists of the characters "<tt>#include</tt>",
followed by a single space, followed by the name of the included
file, followed by a newline sequence.  The name of the included file
isn't enclosed in any quote marks or other delimiters.  This format
is intended to simplify automatic processing of the list by clearly
marking each line in the output that names an included file.  Note
that the list of included files might include a given file more than
once, because each file is listed as it's included, and it is possible
to include a given file more than once.

<li>When the compiler is run with the "-P" option (which writes the
preprocessed version of the source to standard output), the compiler
now prefixes the generated source with the directive <tt>#charset
"utf8"</tt> to indicate the character set of the preprocessed source.

<li>Added a compiler warning message when the preprocessor finds a
line that ends with a backslash followed by whitespace.  While this
format is legal (because it could be useful in defining a macro that
is later "stringized"), it is highly unusual.  Since trailing spaces
are not usually visible in a text editor, the programmer might not
be aware of their presence; and since the presence of the trailing
spaces materially changes the meaning of the program, the compiler
warns about them.  Note that the warning can be suppressed by adding
a comment at the end of the line; this doesn't change the meaning
of the program but does make the spaces visually evident in a text
editor, so the compiler recognizes that the warning isn't necessary
in this case.

<li>Fixed a VM problem that caused the garbage collector to
incorrectly delete intrinsic class objects under certain unusual
circumstances.  When an intrinsic class is used implicitly but never
specifically declared in the compiled program, the VM creates an
object to represent the intrinsic class during the initial program
load.  In the past, it was possible for the garbage collector to
regard such an object as unreachable even though it is always
reachable via the native code implementing its corresponding
intrinsic class.  This problem sometimes led to VM crashes.  The
problem should no longer occur.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused incorrect compilation for a
grammar rule specified with an alternation (two or more sub-rules,
each separated by an "|" symbol) and an empty final sub-rule.  In
such cases, the compiler incorrectly generated two copies of the
empty sub-rule, leading to two match objects being created at
run-time each time the empty sub-rule was matched.  This has been
corrected.

<li>Changed <tt>inherited</tt> so that it searches for the next
inherited definition of the property as though the currently active
method (and any overriding definitions) had simply never been
defined.  This makes <tt>inherited</tt> work roughly the same way as
the <tt>inheritNext</tt> method that was formerly defined in the
<tt>MixIn</tt> class in the adventure game library (adv3).

<li class=last>Added a new <tt>Object</tt> method, <tt>propInherited</tt>, which
determines if a method is inherited, using the new rules of the
<tt>inherited</tt> operator.  This provides functionality equivalent
to the <tt>canInheritNext</tt> method formerly defined in the
<tt>MixIn</tt> class in the adventure game library.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 01/13/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>The compiler can now read <a href="sysman/build.htm">"library"
files</a>, which are lists of
source files to be included in the compilation.  Library files can be
used to simplify compiler command lines and makefiles when including
sets of source files that usually act as a group, such as the
standard adventure library sources.

<li>Workbench can now show library files in the project window.  You
can add a library file to the project window's source file list in
the same way as you can add a source file; the library shows its
contained source files as a subtree.  Each source file within a
library is shown with a checkbox, indicating whether or not the file
is included in compilations; if you want to exclude a file within a
library from compilation, click on the checkbox to remove the
checkmark.  The checkbox settings are stored with the project and
don't affect the library itself, so you can use the same library in a
different project, and include and exclude different sets of files.

<li>The debugger no longer uses a RuntimeError exception to terminate
the program being debugged.  In the past, when the user terminated
the running program using the debugger "Stop" button, or by starting
a new compilation of the program while the program was still running,
the debugger attempted to terminate the program by throwing a
RuntimeError with system error code 2390.  This approach wasn't
completely reliable, because it allowed the running program to
catch the exception and keep running; programs sometimes inadvertantly
caught the error as part of an inclusive "catch" handler, causing
strange interactions with the debugger user interface.  The debugger
now halts the program by telling the VM not to execute any more program
instructions, which guarantees that the program stops immediately.
This new approach should be much more robust and should avoid the
strange effects that sometimes occurred with the old mechanism.

<li>Fixed a problem in the compiler that caused the compiler to hang
when given a makefile (a .t3m file) that didn't end with a newline
character.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that generated an incorrect set of
grammar rule patterns for grammars involving nested alternatives
(i.e., parenthesized "|" expressions).  In the past, the compiler
incorrectly generated multiple copies of the top-level expressions
in such rules, leading to run-time generation of multiple redundant
matches for these expressions.  This has been corrected; the compiler
now generates only one copy of each top-level rule in an alternation.

<li>Fixed an interpreter problem that caused the interpreter to crash
when an HTML &lt;TITLE&gt; tag was displayed.

<li>Fixed a problem in the debugger that caused memory leaks and
other incorrect behavior when the user attempted to run the program,
but the program had not been compiled (or had not been compiled with
debugging information).

<li class=last>When Workbench needs to find a source file during program tracing
in the debugger, it now scans the project list to find the file.  In
the past, the debugger used only the source path to find files,
leading to annoying interactive requests to locate files that were in
plain view in the project window.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 01/05/2002</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added the new intrinsic functions
<a href="sysman/tadsio.htm"><tt>inputLineTimeout()</tt></a>,
which allows reading a line of text with an optional timeout.  This
function can be used to combine command-line input with real-time
effects, because it allows a command line to be interrupted if the
command isn't completed before a real-time interval elapses.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the Dictionary class: the
<tt>isWordDefinedTrunc()</tt> method used the wrong truncation length
in its comparison - it required the string to be matched to be at
least one character longer than the dictionary's truncation length.
It now uses the correct truncation length.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 12/30/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>The compiler now parses a <tt>delegated</tt> expression so that
the object expression is taken to exclude function or method calls.
That is, if parentheses follow the expression giving the target
object of the delegation, these are taken to give the argument list
of the delegation call itself, rather than of the expression giving
the target object value.  This change makes <tt>delegated</tt>
syntactically parallel to <tt>inherited</tt> in that the target
property can be omitted from the expression, in which case the
delegation target property is the same as the property being
evaluated in the caller.  (If a function or method call is desired
in the object expression itself, this can be easily accomplished
by enclosing the entire object expression in parentheses.)

<li>Workbench now stores its project configuration files so that the
absolute file system path to "system" files is not stored; instead,
system files are flagged as system files, and their locations are
stored relative to the system directory.  A "system" file is simply a
file that is stored in the Workbench install directory or any of its
subdirectories; the system directory is the directory containing the
Workbench program executable.  This change makes project
configurations more readily moveable from one system to another,
because it eliminates any dependency in the project configuration
on the particular directory in which Workbench is installed.

<li class=last>The compiler now treats the symbol and object path options as
overriding all module source paths, even when the filenames are given
with "absolute" (as opposed to relative) path names.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 12/23/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added a checksum to the saved game format.  This allows the
interpreter to validate a saved state file, to ensure the file wasn't
corrupted (such as by a text-mode ftp transfer), before attempting to
load the file.

<li>Fixed a problem in the Vector intrinsic class that prevented two
equivalent vectors from comparing equal.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused the compiler to crash in
some cases when a symbol was redefined from function to another type.

<li class=last>Fixed a compiler problem that caused incorrect initialization
of Dictionary objects in the image file in certain cases when
preinitialization ran (i.e., when compiling with the -d option).

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 12/09/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>The compiler now accepts URL-style portable path names in #include
directives, and in fact prefers them.  Refer to the 
<a href="sysman/preproc.htm">preprocessor chapter</a> for details.

<li class=last>Added a new method, <a href="sysman/tadsobj.htm">createClone</a>,
to the TadsObject intrinsic class.  This method returns a newly-created
object that is an identical copy of the original object.

</ul>



<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 12/02/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Changed the tokenizer interface (in tok.t) to return a list of
token elements, rather than parallel value/type lists.  Each token
element in the token list is a sublist, consisting of the following
values:

<ul>
  <li>[1] = token value, as set by the matched rule
  <li>[2] = token type enum, as set by the matched rule
  <li>[3] = original source text matched by the rule that matched the token
</ul>

The tok.h header defines macros that extract these elements of a token;
these should be used rather than direct list elements to make your code
more readable.  The macros are getTokVal(tok), getTokType(tok), and
getTokOrig(tok).  So, if <tt>lst</tt> is a variable containing the
result of calling Tokenizer.tokenize(), and you want to retrieve
the type enum for the third token, you'd write <tt>getTokType(lst[3])</tt>.

<li>Changed the tokenizer's rule specifications for greater power and
symmetry in creating rules:

<ul>
  <li>The "flags" entry has been eliminated.  The functionality of the
  only flag that was defined, TOKFLAG_SKIP, has been replaced with the
  improved behavior of the rule processor.  Since the processor method's
  interface is now powerful enough to subsume the functionality of the
  "skip" flag, the special case embodied in the flag is no longer needed.

  <li>The processor method (element [3] in the sublist defining a rule)
  has a new interface.  In the past, this method took a text match and
  returned a token value.  This interface meant that a given rule was
  limited to generating exactly one token.  The new interface takes
  three arguments, and returns no value:

  <p><pre>
    self.(processorProp)(<i>txt</i>, <i>typ</i>, <i>toks</i>)
  </pre><p>

  <i>txt</i> is the text that matched the rule (this is the same as the
  lone argument to the old interface).  <i>typ</i> is the token type from
  the rule (i.e., element [2] of the sublist defining the rule).
  <i>toks</i> is a Vector containing the token list under construction.
  The method must append the appropriate set of tokens to the Vector
  in <i>toks</i>.  The method is not required to append any tokens; the
  rule in the default tokenizer rule set that matches whitespace, for
  example, doesn't generate any tokens, since whitespace characters have
  no significance other than separating tokens in the default rule set.
  The rule is also allowed to generate more than one token; this is useful
  for rules that generate certain tokens types only if they immediately
  follow particular text patterns.  Note that the processor method is
  not required to use the <i>typ</i> value given, since each new token
  the method adds to the result Vector can be of whatever type is 
  appropriate; the type information is included so that a single processor
  method can be re-used for similar types of processing that produce
  different token types.
</ul>

<li>Changed the intrinsic GrammarProd.parseTokens() method to accept
tokens in the new format returned by the tokenizer.  The method now
takes only two arguments, not three: the second argument that formerly
gave the token type list has been eliminated, since each element of
the token list now includes the type information along with the token
value information.

<li>Changed the Dictionary and GrammarProd intrinsic classes to use
case-sensitive matching exclusively.  Case sensitivity in the past
was inconsistent; all functions are now case-sensitive for
consistency.

<li>The template inheritance mechanism is somewhat altered from its
first implementation.  The 'inherited' keyword can now go anywhere
a template; the inherited token lists are treated as substitutions
for 'inherited' at the point at which it appears in the list.
Furthermore, the compiler now treats each template involving
inheritance as a macro defining all possible inherited templates;
when a template is used, it is matched based on the entire expansion
of the template, not on the partial superclass template.  The net
effect is that a template definition involving an 'inherited'
token is identical to the implied set of fully expanded template
definitions.

<li>The -Fs option can now be used to specify a search path for
source files, rather than a single path for all sources as it did in
the past.  Multiple -Fs options can be specified; each one adds one
directory to the source search path.  When a source file name is
specified in "relative" form (as defined by local filename
conventions), the compiler first looks for the file in the working
directory, then searches the directories specified with -Fs options,
in the order in which the options were specified.  The compiler uses
the first instance of the file it finds.

<li>The compiler automatically adds the system-dependent default
system library directory to the source search path.  This directory
is always searched <i>after</i> all directories specified by
the user with -Fs options.  In effect, the compiler adds an
extra -Fs option for the default system library directory after
all user-specified -Fs options.  This allows library sources
(such as reflect.t or gameinfo.t) to be included in a build
configuration (in a .t3m file, for example) without any path
information; the compiler will automatically find these system
files using the implied -Fs setting.

<li>The compiler's default system library and include directories are
now system-dependent.  On DOS and Windows systems, the default
system header and library directories are the same as the compiler
executable's directory (this is the main directory where the TADS 3
tools are installed).  Check your platform-specific release notes
for details on the locations of these directories on other platforms.

<li>Fixed a problem that allowed objects to be deleted by the
garbage collector when they were referenced as superclasses of
other objects.  This caused unpredictable behavior, including
interpreter crashes.

<li>Fixed a problem that affected the results of t3GetStackTrace() in
the non-debug interpreter when a run-time error occurred.  In such
cases, the stack trace incorrectly omitted the innermost level,
where the error actually occurred.  This has been corrected.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that sometimes caused the compiler to
crash after attempting a link that involved unresolved external
symbol references.

<li class=last>Fixed a GrammarProd parsing problem that caused incorrect token
index information to be returned in certain cases involving productions
with no tokens.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 11/17/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Extended the <a href="sysman/objdef.htm">object template</a>
syntax to allow template inheritance.  A template definition can now
include the keyword "<tt>inherited</tt>" as its final token; this
indicates that the template "inherits" the templates of its
class's superclasses.

<li>The compiler now detects and reports circular class definitions
(that is, class definitions where the class being defined is a subclass
of one or more its purported superclasses).  In the past, the compiler
did not detect such definitions and could get stuck in infinite loops
or unbounded recursion when they were made.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that sometimes caused crashes when an
actual parameter list in a macro expansion was not properly terminated
(with a closing parenthesis) in the source file.

<li>Fixed a problem that affected a few Vector methods by incorrectly
returning an empty vector.  This affected the appendUnique, getUnique,
and mapAll methods.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused a modified intrinsic class
to show a spurious extra property in its getPropList() result list.
This property had an undefined type (type code 16).

<li>Fixed a problem in the Vector class that caused unpredictable
results, including crashes, when adding a large list to a vector.

<li>Fixed a problem in the debugger that caused unpredictable
results, including crashes, when interrupting the program in
mid-statement in certain circumstances.  The problem occurred
sporadically in such cases when the garbage collector happened to run
while the debugger had control, but didn't appear until after
returning control to the program.  This problem only manifested
itself rarely, but could cause crashes when it did appear.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused incorrect code to be
generated for calls to operator <tt>new</tt> where the actual
parameters included one or more "..." expressions (i.e., expanded
variable argument lists).  This affected the <i>calling</i> end,
not the receiving end.  The problem caused the caller to send one
fewer argument than it should have.

<li>Fixed a problem in the output formatter that caused log files
to be generated without proper line wrapping in the HTML version
of the interpreter.

<li class=last>Changed the output formatter so that &lt;BANNER&gt; contents
(everything from a &lt;BANNER&gt; tag to the corresponding
&lt;/BANNER&gt; close tag) are not included in the output log.
The contents of a banner are not logically part of the main text
stream so are not appropriate for inclusion in a log file.  This
ensures that HTML-based status lines and other special display
effects do not interfere with the log file contents.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 10/21/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem that made it impossible to use anonymous functions
that referenced "self" or properties of "self" within property values
defined as simple value expressions (as opposed to methods).  

<li class=last>Changed the compiler to allow using short-form anonymous functions
(i.e., using the "<tt>{args: }</tt>" notation, rather than the "<tt>new
function</tt>" notation) as list elements without enclosing the
functions in parentheses.  In the past, the compiler considered an
open brace at the start of a list element expression as an error; this
was an heuristic intended to catch unterminated list expressions, but
its utility as a diagnostic tool was not sufficient to justify the
superfluous syntax requirement it imposed for this case.

</ul>



<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 10/07/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added special character sequences '\{' and '\}'.  These are used
to group a set of output formatter setting changes: any changes to
the formatter settings made after a '\{' sequence are undone at the
corresponding '\}' sequence.  In particular, the following state
changes are affected:

  <ul>
    <li>\H+
    <li>\H-
    <li>\H
  </ul>

These new sequences can be used to isolate a run of text from the
enclosing text's formatter settings, so that the text within the '\{
\}' pair doesn't have to worry about the enclosing settings and has
no effect on the enclosing settings.  This can be useful, for
example, if a run of text wants to output an HTML-significant
character, but doesn't know if it will be called with HTML
interpretation turned on or off.  In such cases, the text can
turn HTML interpretation off within the brackets without affecting
its caller: "\{\H-&amp;\}" would display an ampersand, regardless
of whether HTML mode was in effect before the text was displayed,
but will have no effect on subsequent text's HTML mode.

<li>Fixed problems in several intrinsic classes related to saving
and restoring.  These bugs caused crashes in some cases when restoring
saved positions.

<li>Changes the restartGame() behavior slightly.  The function invoked
after the restart is now passed the original command line arguments
to the program; the arguments are passed as a list in the second
parameter to the function.  This allows the function to invoke
the normal main program entrypoint as though the program were being
started normally.

<li>If a saved position file is found to be corrupted in the course
of being restored, the interpreter will now force an exit.  There is
no way for the program to retain control in such cases.  If a saved
position file is corrupted, the partially restored machine state at
the point at which the corruption is detected must be considered
invalid, so the VM cannot safely pass control back to the program.
In such cases, the VM terminates the program to avoid the high
likelihood that the program would crash the VM due to the program's
partially corrupted internal state.

<li>Fixed some problems in the "undo" mechanism that caused
unpredictable behavior (including VM crashes) under some
circumstances.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the debugger that caused, in some cases, the
incorrect error code to be reported in the RuntimeError object
representing a VM exception.  This only occurred when the program
was being run in the debugger, and only then when certain types of
expressions were evaluated.  This has been corrected.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 09/30/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last>Changed the symbol file format to allow inclusion of intrinsic
function and intrinsic class registration lists.  This is an internal
change only; its purpose is to make the compiler more flexible in
correlating the internal linkage identifiers of intrinsics across
object modules to eliminate the possibility of certain confusing
linking errors.  In the past, it was necessary to keep intrinsic
definitions in a consistent order across separately compiled modules,
which was problematic for library developers and especially for library
extension developers.  Adding the information to the symbol files
allows the compiler to build an intrinsic identifier list globally
across modules to ensure a consistent ordering, even when the
individual modules have conflicting orderings.  This change should
not be visible to users except to the extent that it eliminates
certain errors relating to intrinsic class and intrinsic function
inclusion order.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 09/09/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added a new function to the <a href="sysman/tadsio.htm">"tads-io" function
set</a>: <tt>flushOutput()</tt>, which immediately flushes text output
to the display and updates the window, if possible.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused incorrect code to be generated
for implicit constructors for classes with multiple superclasses.
This code generation error did not manifest itself frequently, but
when it did show up caused problems ranging from data value corruption
to interpreter crashes.

<li class=last>The debugger now includes an ampersand prefix when displaying
property pointer values.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 08/26/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added new syntax that provides a short-hand notation for defining
a group of properties with similar names and parameters: the new
<a href="sysman/objdef.htm">"propertyset" syntax</a>.

<li>Added a new keyword, "targetprop", a pseudo-variable that
evaluates to the current target property pointer.  The target
property is the property that was invoked to reach the current
method; this new pseudo-variable complements "self" with information
on the property being evaluated in the current "self" object.  The
"targetprop" keyword can only be used in contexts where "self" is
valid.

<li>The "inherited" and "delegated" keywords can be used with new
syntax that omits the target property.  If the target property is
omitted, then the current target property is implied.  The target
property can be omitted from any of the previously-allowed forms of
the "inherited" and "delegated" expressions, as shown here ("delegated"
syntax is parallel to "inherited", so only "inherited" is shown):

   <ul>
   <li><tt>inherited</tt> is equivalent to <tt>inherited.targetprop</tt>
   <li><tt>inherited(<i>arguments</i>)</tt> is equivalent to
        <tt>inherited.targetprop(<i>arguments</i>)</tt>
   <li><tt>inherited <i>superclass_name</i></tt> is equivalent to
        <tt>inherited <i>superclass_name</i>.targetprop</tt>
   <li><tt>inherited <i>superclass_name</i>(<i>arguments</i>)</tt>
        is equivalent to
       <tt>inherited <i>superclass_name</i>.targetprop(<i>arguments</i>)</tt>
   </ul>

<li>Added a new library module, reflect.t, that provides higher-level
reflection services.  This module is optional, but if it is included,
the _main.t module uses reflection to show stack trace listings for
unhandled runtime exceptions.

<li>Added <a href="sysman/t3vm.htm">t3GetStackTrace()</a> to
the 't3vm' intrinsic function set.  This function returns information
on the call stack.

<li>The RuntimeException object defined in _main.t now stores a stack
trace (in the form returned by t3GetStackTrace()) in its stack_
property.  The VM no longer stores an explicit stringized form of
the stack trace when setting the exception message, since the new
stack trace format is more powerful.

<li>Fixed a bug in the TadsObject intrinsic class that sometimes
caused a given property to appear more than once in the getPropList()
method's returned list.  Any given property now appears at most once
in the result list.

<li>The TadsObject intrinsic class now supports createInstance() as a
static method on the intrinsic class.  The expression
TadsObject.createInstance() returns a new instance of TadsObject,
which is the same as defining an object statically like so: "myobj:
object;" - that is, using the "object" keyword rather than a
superclass list.

<li>Fixed a bug in the getPropList() method when called on any
intrinsic class object (e.g., Object, TadsObject, BigNumber).  In
the past, this method returned a list of all of the methods that
were valid on <i>instances</i> of the intrinsic class, not the
methods that were necessarily valid on the intrinsic class object
itself.  This method now returns a list consisting only of the
"static" methods of the intrinsic class, which is to say the methods
that can be called directly on the intrinsic class object itself.

<li>Fixed a bug in the Object intrinsic class's propType() method.
When the property in question was undefined, the method returned
TYPE_NIL, whereas it should have returned nil.  The method now
returns nil for these cases, as documented.

<li>Fixed a bug in the compiler that caused incorrect code generation
when a variable argument list parameter variable was referenced from
within an anonymous function within the function or method with the
variable argumetn list parameter.

<li class=last>The compiler now specifially flags code using '=' to define a
method.  Since this was valid TADS 2 syntax, and has been
gratuitously changed in TADS 3, users are likely to use the old
syntax accidentally, especially while transitioning to the new
language.  The compiler catches these cases so that it can generate
specific and clear error messages; this should help ease the
transition to the new syntax by spelling out plainly the new
syntax requirement.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 08/12/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused incorrect code to be generated
for expressions of the form <tt>obj.(prop)(args)</tt>, where <tt>prop</tt>
is a property of <tt>self</tt> whose value is a property pointer.
An expressions of this form is equivalent to the form
<tt>obj.(self.prop)(args)</tt>, but the compiler in the past incorrectly
interpreted this as equivalent to <tt>obj.prop(args)</tt> - that is,
rather than evaluating <tt>(self.prop)</tt> and then calling the
property of <tt>obj</tt> given by the resulting property pointer value
with the given argument list <tt>args</tt>,
the compiler generated code that called the property <tt>prop</tt>
of <tt>obj</tt> with arguments <tt>args</tt>.  This has been corrected -
the compiler now correctly interprets <tt>obj.(prop)(args)</tt>
as equivalent to <tt>obj.(self.prop)(args)</tt>.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused incorrect code to be generated
for <tt>delegated</tt> expressions involving variable argument lists.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused a spurious warning under
certain circumstances.  If a property was used only in an address
expression ("&amp;prop") in a module, and no object ever defined
a value for the property, a call to the property in a separate
module incorrectly generated a warning indicating a call to a
possibly undefined property name.  This warning was spurious because
the use of the property name in an address expression is enough to
definitively establish the symbol as a property.

<li>Fixed an output formatter problem that caused the text-mode
interpreter to hang (in an infinite loop internally) in response to
certain "&amp;" entities in HTML mode.

<li class=last>Fixed a problem in the GrammarProd intrinsic class that caused
productions that matched zero tokens to indicate invalid token index
values for firstTokenIndex and lastTokenIndex.  These now always
indicate zero in such case, to indicate that the production is
associated with no tokens.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 08/05/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added file safety level checking to the File intrinsic class.  The
initial implementation of File did not check the safety level set in the
user preferences; the File class now correctly checks to ensure each
open-file operation is allowed by the user's safety level settings.
On a safety level violation, the "open" functions throw the new
exception FileSafetyException.

<li class=last>Text files can now be opened in FileAccessReadWriteKeep and
FileAccessReadWriteTrunc modes.  In the past, only "data" and "raw"
files could be opened in read/write modes, which made it impossible
to append to an existing text file.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 07/22/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem with using 'modify' with intrinsic classes.  In the
past, if more than one 'modify' statement was applied to an intrinsic
class, only the last of the 'modify' statements was actually taken into
account at run-time.  This has been corrected.

<li class=last>Fixed a compiler bug: the compiler did not report an error if a
'replace' statement replaced an object but did not specify a superclass
list for the new object.  The compiler misinterpreted such a statement as
a new anonymous object definition.  This has been corrected; the compiler
now flags the missing superclass list as an error.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 07/16/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem in the List class that could cause an object to
be improperly deleted by the garbage collector under certain obscure
circumstances.  (In particular, if an object was being assigned to
a list element, and the garbage collector ran in the course of the
creation of the new list for the result of the assignment, the object
on the right-hand side of the assignment was lost if not otherwise
referenced.)

<li>Fixed a problem that occurred with <tt>propDefined(prop,
PROPDEF_GET_CLASS)</tt> when the property of interest was an
intrinsic method (i.e., a TYPE_NATIVE_CODE value).  In these cases,
the return value of the method was an invalid value, which caused
problems if used, including interpreter crashes.  In such cases,
<tt>propDefined()</tt> now properly returns the intrinsic class
object where the intrinsic method is defined.

<li>Extended the <a href="sysman/objdef.htm">object template</a>
mechanism to allow class-specific templates to be defined.

<li>Extended the <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm">firstObj()</a> and 
<a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm">nextObj()</a> intrinsic functions to
take a new <i>flags</i> argument, which allows the caller to specify
whether to enumerate instances only, classes only, or both.

<li>Changed the TadsObject class to allow use of the <tt>new</tt>
operator with no arguments.  In the past, at least one argument
(giving the immediate superclass of the new object) was required;
now a <tt>new TadsObject</tt> with no arguments is understood to
create a base TadsObject.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/file.htm">File intrinsic class</a>, which
provides a new interface to external file input/output.  This replaces
the file-related functions in the <a href="sysman/tadsio.htm">"tads-io"
intrinsic function set</a>, which have been removed.  Specifically,
the following functions have been removed:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>fileClose</tt>
    <li><tt>fileGetPos</tt>
    <li><tt>fileOpen</tt>
    <li><tt>fileRead</tt>
    <li><tt>fileSeek</tt>
    <li><tt>fileSeekEnd</tt>
    <li><tt>fileWrite</tt>
  </ul>
<b>Important note: This change is not upwardly compatible.</b>  All existing
code must be recompiled for this change, and any code using the fileXxx
functions must be modified to use the new File intrinsic class.  The
necessary code changes are relatively straightforward, since the names
of the new File methods are similar to those of the old functions.

<li>The compiler now generates an implicit constructor for each 
object or class that inherits from multiple base classes and does
not provide an explicit constructor.  The implicit constructor
simply invokes each base class's constructor, in the same order
in which the base classes are listed in the superclass list.

<li>Added grouped sub-alternatives to rules in the 
<a href="sysman/gramprod.htm"><tt>grammar</tt> statement</a>.  This allows
portions of an alternative in a rule definition to be grouped for
alternation; for example, a rule can be defined as
"<tt>('take' | 'get' | 'pick' 'up') nounList-&gt;lst_</tt>", which
is more concise than flattening out the grouped alternation manually.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/preproc.htm"><tt>#ifempty</tt> and
<tt>#ifnempty</tt></a> variable-arguments expansion operators,
which allow conditional expansion in a varargs macro depending on
whether or not the varargs part is empty.

<li>Added the -P option to t3make: this preprocesses the source file,
writing the expanded results on standard output.  When -P is
specified, no compilation or linking is performed, so no object or
image files are created.

<li>Added new <a href="sysman/string.htm">String intrinsic class</a>
methods: <tt>startsWith()</tt>, <tt>endsWith()</tt>, and
<tt>mapToByteArray</tt>.

<li>Added a feature to the <tt>substr()</tt> method of the
<a href="sysman/string.htm">String intrinsic class</a>: if the starting
index (the first argument) is negative, it indicates an offset
from the end of the string: -1 is the last character of the string,
-2 the second-to-last, and so on.

<li>Added a new function to the <a href="sysman/tadsio.htm">"tads-io" function
set</a>: <tt>getLocalCharSet</tt>, which returns the name of one of the
active local character sets on the current system.

<li>Added new functionality to the <a href="sysman/tadsio.htm">"tads-io"
function set</a> for files.  Files can now be opened in "raw" mode,
which allows reading and writing byte arrays.  Bytes written to and
read from a file in raw mode are not translated or modified in any
way; this mode offers direct access to external files, for purposes
such as manipulating files in formats defined by other applications.
The <tt>fileRead()</tt> and <tt>fileWrite()</tt> functions in this
mode take ByteArray arguments.

<li>Added new functionality to the <a href="sysman/tadsio.htm">"tads-io"
function set</a>: the <tt>fileOpen()</tt> routine can now take an
object of intrinsic class <a href="sysman/charset.htm">CharacterSet</a>
instead of a character set name.  If you've already instantiated
a CharacterSet object for other reasons, it is more efficient to
re-use the same object by reference in this manner than to pass
the name of the character set to <tt>fileOpen()</tt>, since 
<tt>fileOpen()</tt> has to create another mapping object when
given only a character set name.

<li>Added the new <a href="sysman/charset.htm">CharacterSet</a> intrinsic
class.

<li>Added the new <a href="sysman/bytearr.htm">ByteArray</a> intrinsic
class.

<li>In the <a href="sysman/objic.htm">Object intrinsic class</a>, method
formerly known as <tt>isClass()</tt> has been renamed to
<tt>ofKind()</tt>.  x.ofKind(y) returns true if x is an instance or
subclass or y.  In addition, this method has been changed so that
x.ofKind(x) returns true for any x.

<li>Added a built-in character set mapping for ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1).
This character set is in widespread use because of its status as the
default HTTP character set, and has an especially simple mapping to
Unicode, so it seemed worthwhile to add as a built-in set not requiring
an external mapping file.  The assigned name of the set is "iso-8859-1".

<li>Changed the compiler's former <tt>-r</tt> option to <tt>-a</tt>,
and the former <tt>-rl</tt> to <tt>-al</tt>.  (The <tt>-a</tt> option
forces recompilation of all involved modules even when not out of
date with respect to the source files, and <tt>-al</tt> forces
relinking even when the image file isn't out of date with respect
to the object files; these options effectively override the compiler's
normal dependency analysis for cases when the automatic analysis is
incorrect for some reason.)  This change is gratuitous and cosmetic,
but makes the compiler's option names more closely resemble that of
traditional "make" programs.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug: the compiler reported a spurious "symbol
already defined" warning when a particular grammar production had
rules defined in multiple modules.  This has been corrected.

<li>Fixed a preprocessor bug: if the argument of a #message was
missing its closing right parenthesis, the preprocessor got stuck
in an infinite loop.  This has been corrected.

<li>Fixed a bug in the <a href="sysman/vector.htm">Vector intrinsic
class</a> (and, by inheritance, in the Array intrinsic class): if the
<tt>insertAt</tt> method was called on an empty vector, a crash
occurred.  This has been corrected.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused the compiler to crash if
confronted with a <tt>foreach</tt> statement in the absence of
the definition of the Collection and Iterator classes.  This
has been corrected; the compiler now generates the appropriate
error message and recovers gracefully.

<li>Fixed a problem with the grammar production object that caused
new match tree objects to bypass constructors on creation.  The
match tree constructors are now invoked as for any other object
instantiation.

<li>Fixed a problem in the debugger that prevented the debugger from
taking control on a run-time exception being thrown when another
run-time exception had previously occurred at the same place twice in
a row with no intervening debugger activity.

<li>Fixed a problem that caused the debugger to crash under some
unusual conditions when an entry in the local-variables window
was selected and later automatically removed due to an execution
context change.

<li>Improved the robustness of the debugger when the program
being debugged caused a stack-overflow exception.

<li>Updated the calc.t example to the new GrammarProd.parseTokens()
interface.

<li>Fixed a bug that caused comparisons of any two function pointers
to yield unequal, even for equivalent function pointers.  This bug
had numerous subtle manifestations; for example, a function pointer
key in a LookupTable could never be found, since a test for equality
to the key would never succeed.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused the incorrect error message to
be reported when a replace/modify of an extern object was out of order
in a link (the message reported that a function rather than object
was involved).

<li>Removed a spurious warning that was generated when a dictionary
was imported from multiple symbol files.

<li class=last>Fixed a bug in the GrammarProd intrinsic class that caused "*"
tokens in subproductions to be misinterpreted.  In the past, the "*"
token only worked properly in top-level productions (i.e., a production
on which parseTokens() was called); this has been corrected so that "*"
works properly at any level.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 05/05/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Incompatible intrinsic class API change:</b> The return value
of the <tt>parseTokens()</tt> method in the <a
href="sysman/gramprod.htm">GrammarProd intrinsic class</a> has been changed.
In the past, this method returned a list, each of whose elements was
a sublist of two elements.  Each sublist described one successful
match tree; the first element of each sublist was the number of
tokens matched, and the second was the root object of the match tree.
The 4/29/2001 version added the firstTokenIndex and lastTokenIndex
properties to the match objects; since the number of tokens matched
in a tree can be inferred from the firstTokenIndex and lastTokenIndex
values, the token counts in the return sublists were redundant.
Therefore, to simplify the API, the sublists have been eliminated,
and <tt>parseTokens()</tt> now returns simply a list of match tree
root objects.  To obtain the token count for a match, simply calculate
<tt>(match.lastTokenIndex - match.firstTokenIndex - 1)</tt>, where
<tt>match</tt> is the root object in the match tree.  Since the root
object in a tree encompasses the entire match, its token range
necessarily encompasses the range of tokens for the entire match.

<li>Added <a href="sysman/preproc.htm">variable-argument macros</a>.

<li>Fixed a problem in the <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">GrammarProd intrinsic
class</a> that prevented a rule from being matched when it ended with
the special '*' token and was used as a subproduction in another rule.
This now works correctly.

<li>Fixed a problem in the compiler that caused a spurious warning
message indicating that a dictionary symbol had been imported multiple
times.  This warning was generated whenever the dictionary was declared
in more than one source file but not in <i>all</i> source files; each
file that did <i>not</i> declare the dictionary displayed the warning.
This has been corrected.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/expr.htm"><tt>delegated</tt> keyword</a>,
which allows delegating a method call to an unrelated object.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm"><tt>getMethodDefiner()</tt>
intrinsic function</a>, which returns the object that defines the currently
executing method.

<li class=last>Changed the default name of the ASCII character set mapping to
"us-ascii" for better readability.  The old name ("asc7dflt") is still
accepted, but is now obsolescent and should not be used in new code.
All of the #charset directives in the system headers provided with the
compiler have been updated to use the new "us-ascii" name.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 04/29/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a problem in the <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">GrammarProd intrinsic
class</a> that caused incorrect results to be returned with
productions that matched exactly zero tokens.

<li>Extended the <tt>grammar</tt> syntax to allow the "<tt>-&gt;</tt>"
notation to be used with literal tokens.  In the past, the arrow was
only allowed with symbol-match tokens (subproductions and token classes),
but it is often desirable to be able to retrieve the matching token even
for a literal match.  There are two cases in particular where a literal's
matching token is needed to reconstruct the original input: when the
literal is matched with truncation; and when a production has several
alternatives with different literals.

<li>Modified the <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">GrammarProd intrinsic class</a>
so that each match object now includes more direct information on the
tokens involved in the match.  The parser now sets the
firstTokenIndex and lastTokenIndex properties of each match object to
indicate the index of the first token and of the last token,
respectively, that are involved in matching the rule corresponding to
the match object.  This is a simple range, so all of the tokens from
the first to the last, inclusive, constitute the match's original
text.  In addition, the parser sets the tokenList property of each
match tree item to the original token list passed into parseTokens()
(this doesn't take up nearly as much memory as it might at first
appear, since all of the match objects reference a single shared copy
of the token list).  The exported properties firstTokenIndex,
lastTokenIndex, and tokenList are defined in gramprod.h.

<li>The compiler now creates a dictionary entry in the default
dictionary, if one is defined, for each literal string that appears
in a <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">"grammar"</a> statement's rule list.  If no
default dictionary is defined when a "grammar" statement is
encountered, the statement's literals are not entered into any
dictionary.  Each literal string is associated with the production
object and the property "miscVocab".  Since these strings are now
stored in the dictionary, it is simple to determine if a word is
defined in any context; without the grammar literal dictionary
entries, it was not possible to determine if a given string, when
entered by a user at run-time, was known in the context of a grammar
literal.

<li>The <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">"grammar"</a> syntax has been extended
to allow a "tag" to be associated with each "grammar" statement.  To
specify a tag, specify any symbol or number in parentheses after the
production name.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
    grammar nounPhrase(1): adjective->adj_ : object ;
</pre>

<p>The tag's only purpose is to provide an identifying name for the
new "grammarInfo" method, described below.

<li>The compiler now automatically creates a method for each
<a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">grammar</a> match object that makes it possible to
traverse match trees without knowing their internal structure in
advance.  The new method is called "grammarInfo," and it returns a
list.  The list's first element is a string giving the name of the
production, with the optional tag (see above) enclosed in parentheses
after the production's symbolic name.  Each subsequent element is the
value of a property appearing after an arrow ("-&gt;") in the production's
rule list.

<li>Modified the <a href="sysman/gramprod.htm">grammar</a> production matching
algorithm so that [badness] matches are examined as a group rather
than individually.  In particular, when a number of [badness]
alternatives arise simultaneously, the parser had in the past
examined only one such alternative at a time once determining that no
better matches were available.  Now, all [badness] alternatives with
the lowest badness value are examined in parallel.  This is important
in some cases for the same reasons that parallel consideration of
regular alternatives is necessary.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused spurious "variable assigned
but not used" warnings in certain situations.  In particular, if a
local variable was defined in a nested scope within a method, and the
variable was used only within the lexical confines of an anonymous
function within the nested scope, the compiler did not correctly mark
the variable as having been used and thus incorrectly reported the
warning.  This problem did not affect code generation; its only
effect was the unnecessary warning.

<li>Enhanced the Dictionary intrinsic class's findWord() and
findWordTrunc() methods so that the property argument in each can be
omitted or specified as nil, in which case all objects with vocabulary
matching given text, for any part-of-speech property, will be
returned.

<li class=last>Fixed a debugger problem that caused a crash in some obscure
cases involving opening a file during a debugger session when the
debugger had never taken control since the beginning of program
execution, and a similar problem that occurred when the VM threw
a run-time error exception under similar circumstances.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 04/15/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>A new mechanism allows capturing calls to undefined methods and
properties.  When a call is made to an undefined method, the VM now
calls a new property, <tt><a href="sysman/undef.htm">propNotDefined()</a></tt>,
on the target object.  The new method receives as arguments the
the undefined property ID and the arguments to the original method
call.  If <tt>propNotDefined</tt> is itself not defined, the VM
simply returns nil for the undefined method call, as it did in the
past.

<li>Added some new <a href="sysman/regex.htm">regular expression</a> features:
<ul>
   <li>Character classes can now be combined with '|', as in
       &lt;upper|digit&gt; (matches any upper-case letter or any digit).
   <li>Character classes can now be complemented with '^', as in
       &lt;^upper&gt; (matches anything <i>except</i> upper-case letters).
   <li>Added some <a href="sysman/regex.htm">named character
       expressions</a>, which look similar to character-class expressions,
       and which can be combined with character-class expressions via
       '|': &lt;upper|star&gt; matches any upper-case letter or an asterisk.
</ul>

<li class=last>Renamed the t23run.exe executable to simply tr32.exe, so the
combined TADS 2+3 interpreter is now the default interpreter.  The
separate interpreters are now called t2r32.exe (for TADS 2) and
t3run.exe (for TADS 3).  For the most part, users will not need to
run the version-specific interpreters at all; the only time these
should be needed is when bundling a game into an executable, in which
case it is desirable for the sake of minimizing file sizes to include
only the version of the interpreter actually needed.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 3/28/2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>The object definition syntax has been extended to allow an object's
property list to be enclosed in braces.  Refer to the 
<a href="sysman/objdef.htm">Object Definitions documentation</a> for details.

<li>The object definition syntax now provides <a
href="sysman/objdef.htm">"nested" objects</a>.  A nested object
is an anonymous object defined in-line within another object, with a
property of the enclosing object initialized with a reference to the
nested object; this syntax is convenient for defining certain types
of small helper objects.

<li>The language now has a <a href="sysman/objdef.htm">static property
initialization</a> syntax, which allows a property to be initialized with
a non-constant value computed at compile-time.

<li>Changed the behavior of the '+' property.  The new behavior is
much simpler than the previous behavior: if an object is defined
with <i>N</i> plus signs, its '+' property is initialized to the
most recent object defined with <i>N</i>-1 plus signs.  Explicitly
setting the '+' property in an object list is now irrelevant.
Refer to the <a href="sysman/objdef.htm">documentation</a> for details.

<li>Changed the default filename suffix for image files to ".t3" (it
was formerly ".t3x") to make image filenames somewhat more friendly looking.

<li>Added the new executable "t23run" - this is a 32-bit console-mode
combined TADS 2 and TADS 3 interpreter.  You can use this single
application to run games compiled for TADS 2 or TADS 3.  This version
of the interpreter is <i>not</i> designed for bundling single-file
games for distribution, since this would unnecessarily increase the
size of bundled games; use the appropriate single-version interpreter
executable for bundling.

<li>Added the new executable "html23" - this is a combined TADS 2 and
TADS 3 version of the HTML interpreter.

<li>For anyone interested in porting the combined command-line
interpreter on another platform, the code that implements this should
be easily portable to other command-line operating systems.  See
the target 't23run.exe' in win32/makefile.vc5; you can find the source
code for the main program entrypoint in vmcl23.cpp.  For systems that
don't use Unix-style command lines, the command line code itself won't
be portable, but portable code for sensing the engine version
needed to run a given game file can be found in vmmain.cpp.

<li>Fixed a bug that caused problems with certain "reflection"
methods when the program used <tt>modify</tt> to extend the
<tt>TadsObject</tt> intrinsic class.  If the program modified
<tt>TadsObject</tt>, then traversed the object tree (using the
<tt>getSuperclassList()</tt> method), or used the
<tt>propDefined()</tt> method, the behavior was incorrect, and could
lead to VM crashes.  This has been corrected.

<li>Added <a href="sysman/charmap.htm">documentation</a> on the <tt>#charset</tt>
directive and using source files encoded in Unicode UCS-2.

<li>Added a <tt>#charset "asc7dflt"</tt> directive to each system
source and header file included with the compiler distribution.  This
directive ensures that the compiler interprets the contents of the system
files correctly, in case the user wants to specify a default character
set for the compilation with the <tt>-cs</tt> compiler option.

<li>The compiler now accepts Unicode character 0x2028 ("line
separator") as equivalent to a newline in source files that use of
the Unicode encodings the compiler accepts (UCS-2 big-endian, UCS-2
little-endian, or UTF-8).

<li class=last>In text mode, the <tt>fileRead()</tt> function now properly
translates input characters according to the character set selected
when the file was opened.  (In the past, the character set was
ignored, and the characters from the file were not properly
translated to Unicode.)  In addition, the <tt>fileRead()</tt>
function accepts Unicode character 0x2028 (the Unicode line separator
character) as equivalent to a newline (but note that, as always, the
text returned from <tt>readLine()</tt> represents each end-of-line
with a single '\n' character, regardless of the type of line
termination in the underlying file).

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for February 24, 2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/t3vm.htm"><tt>t3AllocProp()</tt></a>
intrinsic function, which allocates a new property ID.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/objic.htm">
<tt>Object.getPropList()</tt></a>
method, which returns a list of properties directly defined by an object.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/objic.htm">
<tt>Object.getPropParams(<i>prop</i>)</tt></a> method, which returns
information on the parameters taken by a property or method.

<li class=last>Added the <a href="sysman/tadsgen.htm">
<tt>getFuncParams(<i>funcptr</i>)</tt></a> intrinsic function, which
returns information ont he parameters taken by a function.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for February 10, 2001</h3>

<ul>

<li>The new <a href="sysman/proccode.htm"><tt>property</tt> statement</a>
allows a program to explicitly declare property symbols.  This is optional,
but can be useful in certain cases in library code.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/lookup.htm">LookupTable intrinsic class</a>,
which implements a general-purpose associative array type.  A LookupTable
is similar to a Vector, but whereas a Vector can use only integers as
indices, a Hashtable can use any value as an index.

<li>Added the new <a href="sysman/reflect.htm"><tt>t3GetGlobalSymbols()</tt></a> 
intrinsic function, which provides programmatic access to the
compile-time names of objects, properties, functions, intrinsic
classes, and enumerators.

<li>The preprocessor now treats square brackets ("[ ]") and braces
("{ }") as grouping symbols when parsing macro arguments.  In the past,
only parentheses were counted.  This allows list constants and anonymous
functions to be used more easily as macro arguments.

<li>In <tt>_main.t</tt>, added a new function, <tt>initAfterLoad()</tt>.
The main program entrypoint in <tt>_main.t</tt> (function <tt>_main()</tt>)
calls this new routine to perform initialization.  This routine sets up
the default display function, performs pre-initialization if necessary,
then performs regular load-time initialization.  All of these operations
were previously carried out in <tt>_main()</tt>; the reason they've been
separated into a new function is to allow the same operations to be called
after a <tt>restartGame</tt> operation.  Since a <tt>restartGame</tt>
effectively re-loads the image file and starts the game over from
scratch, the same initialization that <tt>_main()</tt>
performs at initial load must be performed immediately after a restart;
this function makes this common code easy to re-use.

<li>Added a new method to the TadsObject intrinsic class:
createInstance(), which creates an instance of the object.  This
method passes its arguments to the new object's constructor, if any,
and returns a reference to the new object.

<li>Added <tt>execAfterMe</tt> to <tt>ModuleExecObject</tt> in
<tt>_main.t</tt>.  User code can initialize this property in a given
<tt>ModuleExecObject</tt> instance to contain a list of other
<tt>ModuleExecObject</tt> instances that are to be initialized
<b>after</b> the given instance; this is analogous to the
<tt>execBeforeMe</tt> list, but allows an object to specify things
that are to come after it.  It is sometimes desirable to be able to
specify initialization order dependencies by specifying what must
follow rather than what must precede initialization of a given object,
and this new property provides the flexibility to specify order
dependencies either way.

<li>A makefile for DJGPP (the definitive port of Gnu C/C++ for MS-DOS)
is now included in the source distribution.  This makefile can be used
to create a 32-bit version of the interpreter that will run on MS-DOS
on PC's with 386 or later processors.

<li>Fixed a VM problem that caused modification of the root intrinsic
object (i.e., <tt>modify Object</tt>) to fail.  In the past, the VM
simply failed to execute code added to the root intrinsic object with
<tt>modify</tt>.  This has been corrected; code added to
<tt>Object</tt> is now properly inherited from the other intrinsic
classes.

<li>The String and List intrinsic classes can now be extended with
the <tt>modify</tt> mechanism.  In the past, the VM did not correctly
handle code extensions to the String and List intrinsic classes.

<li>Fixed a compiler bug that caused incorrect code generation 
when adding a constant zero value to a local variable which, at run-time,
ends up containing a vector, list, or other non-integer value.

<li>The Vector intrinsic class can now be used with the <tt>foreach</tt>
keyword to loop over the elements in a vector.  (In previous versions,
the Vector class incorrectly omitted support for <tt>foreach</tt>.)

<li>The "Frames" version of the documentation should now work
correctly with Netscape and other browsers that had trouble with past
versions.  (The frames page had some ill-formed HTML, which some
browsers rejected, but this page has now been corrected.)

<li>Changed the text of the VM error message that results from
applying an index to a type that cannot be indexed (nil[3], for
example).  In the past, the message read "invalid type for indexing -
value cannot be index," which incorrectly signified that there was
something wrong with the index value, when in fact the value being
indexed was the problem.  The message has been changed to read
"invalid index operation - this type of value cannot be indexed."

<li>Fixed a problem in the Vector intrinsic class that caused
a vector's data to be corrupted by certain operations that should have,
but did not, increase the internal storage space allocated for the
Vector object.

<li>Fixed a compiler problem with object templates.  The compiler
did not properly parse object templates that included list tokens;
this has been corrected.

<li>Fixed a bug in the <tt>rand()</tt> intrinsic function.  In the
past, this function crashed the interpreter if the argument was a
list with no elements.  This has been corrected; the function now
returns <tt>nil</tt> when the argument is a list with no elements.

<li>Fixed a problem with the <tt>Vector</tt> intrinsic class that
caused pre-initialized data to be loaded incorrectly.

<li>Corrected the documentation (the <a href="sysman/expr.htm">expressions
chapter</a>) to reflect the correct precedence of the "<tt>[]</tt>" and
"<tt>.</tt>" operators, which should be above the unary operators.

<li>Added four new methods to the <a href="sysman/list.htm">List intrinsic
class</a>: <tt>prepend(<i>val</i>)</tt>, which inserts a new value at
the start of a list; <tt>insertAt(<i>index, val1, val2, ...</i>)</tt>,
which inserts one or more values into a list at a given position;
<tt>removeElementAt(<i>index</i>)</tt>, which deletes the element
at the given index; and <tt>removeRange(<i>startIndex, endIndex</i>)</tt>,
which removes the elements in the given range of indices.

<li>Added a new method to the <a href="sysman/vector.htm">Vector intrinsic
class</a>: <tt>prepend(<i>val</i>)</tt>, which inserts a new value at
the start of a vector.

<li>It is no longer legal to apply the unary "<tt>&amp;</tt>"
operator to an object symbol.  In the past,
"<tt>&amp;<i>objectName</i></tt>" was the same as simply
"<tt><i>objectName</i></tt>"; this is no longer legal.
"<tt>&amp;<i>objectName</i></tt>" was never a meaningful construct,
since an object symbol yields a reference to the object to begin
with, but past versions of the compiler accepted it without complaint
and treated it as equivalent to the unadorned object symbol; the
compiler now rejects this construct.

<li>It is no longer legal to apply the unary "<tt>&amp;</tt>"
operator to a function name symbol.  In the past,
"<tt>&amp;<i>functionName</i></tt>" yielded a reference to the
function.  This has been changed so that the function name used
by itself yields a reference to the function, just as an object
name does.

<li>Because the "<tt>&amp;</tt>" operator can no longer be used with
any symbol types other than properties, there is no longer a warning
when using the operator with an otherwise undefined symbol name.
"<tt>&amp;<i>symbol</i></tt>" now unambiguously defines the symbol
as a property name.

<li class=last>Fixed a compiler bug that caused a spurious warning message when
compiling certain types of expressions involving property pointers.
The warning did not affect code generation, but it was incorrect and
has been removed.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for version 3.0.2 (September 27, 2000)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a compiler problem that caused the compiler to go into an
infinite loop (and therefore freeze up) when confronted with a 'switch'
statement containing code before the first 'case' or 'default' label.
This has been corrected; the compiler now reports an error (such code
is unreachable) and continues with the compilation.

<li class=last>Fixed a minor compiler problem that generated a spurious warning
message in a certain situation.  Specifically, if none of a 'switch'
statement's 'case' labels led to code paths that could reach the next
statement after the 'switch' (for example, if every code path
reachable from a 'case' label led to a 'return' statement), but the
'switch' had no 'default' label, the compiler generated the warning
message "unreachable statement" at the next executable statement
after the 'switch'.  This warning was incorrect because, in most
cases, it is not safe to assume that every possible value of a
switch's controlling expression is included in the list of explicit
cases, hence the next statement following a 'switch' with no
'default' is reachable any time the controlling expression's value is
not in the list of explicit 'case' labels.  Note that this problem
merely caused the spurious warning and did not affect code
generation.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for June 24, 2000</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last>Fixed a compiler problem with try/catch statements.  The compiler
did not correctly generate handlers for any catch block past the
first for a given try statement; this has been corrected.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for version 3.0.1 (June 17, 2000)</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last>The meaning of the syntax <tt>x.y</tt> and <tt>&amp;y</tt> have
changed slightly, in a way that will be transparent to most code.
In the past, if <tt>y</tt> was a local variable, then <tt>x.y</tt>
evaluated the local, then called the method on <tt>x</tt> specified
by the property pointer value in the local; <tt>&amp;y</tt> simply
generated a compilation error because a local's address cannot be
evaluated.  This behavior has changed.  Now, <tt>x.y</tt> and
<tt>&amp;y</tt> both ignore the local definition of <tt>y</tt> and
interpreter <tt>y</tt> as a property name.  This change is important
because it allows code to refer to a property explicitly, even when
a local of the same name has been defined in the code block.  For
example:

<p>
<pre>
   myObject: object
     obj = nil
     setObj(obj) { self.obj = obj; }
   ;
</pre>
<p>
In the past, the code above would have had to use a different name
for the formal parameter variable <tt>obj</tt>, because it would not
have been able to refer to the property of the same name.  With the
new interpretation, the code can distinguish between the local and
the property by referring to the property explicitly using <tt>self.obj</tt>.

<p>Note that it is still simple to obtain the old behavior of
evaluating the local variable and calling a method via the resulting
property pointer.  To do this, simply enclose the local in
parentheses: <tt>x.(y)</tt>.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 5/21/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add a new <a href="sysman/vector.htm">Vector</a> intrinsic class, a subclass
of Array that combines the reference semantics of an Array with the
dynamic sizing capabilities of a List.  Vector is substantially more
efficient than List when constructing a collection iteratively.

<li>Added some new List methods:
<a href="sysman/list.htm">sort</a>,
<a href="sysman/list.htm">append</a>,
<a href="sysman/list.htm">appendUnique</a>.

<li>Added new Array methods: sort, appendUnique.

<li>Added an <a href="sysman/errtrans.htm">error message translation
mechanism</a>, which allows non-English versions of the interpreter's
and compiler's error messages to be substituted at run-time.
Messages can be loaded from an external file, so there is no need to
recompile the system to switch languages.  (At the moment, of course,
only an English set of messages actually comes with the system, but
it is hoped that a few translated versions will be contributed so
that more languages will be supported "out of the box" in the future.)

<li class=last>Fixed a bug that reversed the order of arguments in calls to
anonymous functions while running in the debugger.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 5/11/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>Changed the name of the <tt>say</tt> function in the "tads-io"
intrinsic function set to <a
href="sysman/tadsio.htm"><tt>tadsSay</tt></a>.  This allows the
library to define its own higher-level function called <tt>say</tt>;
since user code should almost always call the library's function
rather than the low-level direct console output function, it is
desirable to give the library version the shorter, more convenient
name.

<li class=last>Added the <tt>appendUnique()</tt> method to the <a
href="sysman/list.htm">List</a> and Array intrinsic classes.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 4/24/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li class=last>Fixed a bug in the compiler that caused lost properties on objects
under certain very complicated circumstances (the problem occurred when
dictionaries and other objects were defined in a particular order).

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 4/22/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/proccode.htm"><tt>foreach</tt> statement</a>.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/collect.htm">Collection</a> and <a
href="sysman/iter.htm"> Iterator</a> classes.  <a
href="sysman/list.htm">List</a> and Array are now subclasses of
Collection, so these classes can create Iterator objects to visit
their elements.

<li class=last>The Windows HTML interpreter now supports PNG transparency (this is
a generic change to the Windows HTML renderer that will also be in
HTML TADS 2.5.4).  Note that only simple transparency is supported;
full alpha blending is still not supported.  PNG transparency now has
its own systemInfo() capability code, SYSINFO_PNG_TRANS.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes for 4/16/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a bug that caused a compiler crash when a source 
file was completely empty (or contained only comments).

<li class=last>Fixed a bug that caused a compiler crash in certain situations
involving multiple initializers in a single 'local' statement.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes since 3.0.0</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/string.htm">htmlify()</a> method to the
String class.  This method converts any HTML markup-significant characters
in the string to their HTML equivalents; in particular, it converts
an ampersand ("&amp;") to "&amp;amp;" and a less-than sign ("&lt;")
to "&amp;lt;", and can also optionally quote spaces, tabs, and newlines
to ensure display fidelity for these whitespace characters as well.

<li>Added a <a href="sysman/regex.htm">
shortest-match modifier</a> to the regular expression closure
operators ("*", "+", and "?").  This feature provides precise control
over how matches are allocated in expressions involving multiple
closures.

<li>Added the <a href="sysman/regex.htm">non-capturing
modifier</a> to the regular expression group syntax; this allows a
parenthesized group to be omitted from the counted groups.

<li>Added <a
href="sysman/regex.htm">look-ahead assertions</a> to
the regular expression syntax.

<li>Added the regular expression <a
href="sysman/regex.htm">interval operator</a>, which provides a
compact notation for specifying a specific number of repetitions of a
sub-expression.

<li>Renamed a few <a href="sysman/list.htm">list methods</a> and array
methods, and expanded both sets for greater consistency and more
complete functionality:

   <ul>
   <li>indexOf
   <li>indexWhich
   <li>valWhich
   <li>lastIndexOf
   <li>lastIndexWhich
   <li>lastValWhich
   <li>countOf
   <li>countWhich
   <li>mapAll
   <li>applyAll (arrays only)
   <li>forEach
   <li>getUnique
   </ul>

<li>When the default start-up module (_main.t) is automatically included
in a build, _main.t is linked in first.  It was formerly linked in last,
which didn't allow 'modify' or 'replace' to be used with objects defined
in the module.

<li>When running under the debugger, RuntimeError exceptions now
include stack trace information (with source line information) in the
exceptionMessage string associated with the exception object.  This
makes it easier to track down where a run-time error occurred.  Note
that this information is available only when running under the debugger,
because this is the only time the system has access to the necessary
source line information.

<li>Added a "character map library" mechanism to the 
<a href="sysman/alone.htm">stand-alone interpreter</a>.  This new feature
allows a set of character map (.tcm) files to be bundled with a
stand-alone game, eliminating the need to distribute separate .tcm files
with a stand-alone game.  (Having to distribute .tcm files seemed to
defeat the purpose of building a stand-alone executable.  The new
bundling feature still allows users with localizations that aren't
included in the standard character map set to add their own .tcm files,
but it makes character mappings entirely invisible for most users.)

<li class=last>Added CP1250.TCM (a character set mapping for the Windows
Eastern/Central European code page), CP850.TCM (DOS OEM Latin 1),
and CP852.TCM (DOS OEM Latin 2) to the default character map set
for Windows.

</ul>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes since 03/30/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>Slightly changed the <tt>InitObject</tt> mechanism.  The class
formerly known as <tt>InitObject</tt> is now called
<tt>PreinitObject</tt>, and a new class <tt>InitObject</tt> has been
added.  The new <tt>InitObject</tt> does the same thing that
<tt>PreinitObject</tt> does, but does it at regular program start-up
rather than pre-initialization.  This change makes the
pre-initialization and regular initialization mechanisms work the
same way.  In addition, to make this mechanism more generic, both
<tt>InitObject</tt> and <tt>PreinitObject</tt> now descend from a
base class called <tt>ModuleExecObject</tt>; this class should be
usable as the base class for other types of modular execution
objects, such as perhaps a post-restore initializer sequence, a
command parsing initializer sequence, and so on.  Refer to the
<a href="sysman/init.htm">library pre-initialization</a> documentation for
details.

<li>Added the <tt>-r</tt> option to the interpreter, allowing games to
be restored directly from the command.  The saved state files now include
information on the image file that created them, so if you're restoring
a game, you don't have to specify the image file; this particular feature
also allows double-clicking on a saved state from the desktop to start
the interpreter, load the image file, and restore the saved state.

<li class=last>The GrammarProd intrinsic class's parseTokens() method now
includes truncated matches to dictionary words (according to the
dictionary's truncation length setting) in its structural analysis.
The method also includes truncated matches (again, using the dictionary
setting) for literal tokens in the grammar.  If you don't want to allow
truncated matches, simply change the dictionary's truncation length
setting to zero.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes since 03/26/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added a new <a href="sysman/init.htm">library pre-initialization</a>
mechanism based on "initialization objects" rather than a simple
preinit() method.  This new mechanism should be especially useful for
library developers, since new initialization objects can be plugged in
without touching any library or user code

<li class=last>It is now possible to <a href='t3icext.htm'>extend
intrinsic classes</a> with user-defined methods.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes since 03/21/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>The method-based API to certain functions that were formerly
implemented as intrinsics is now official.  The trailing underscores
on the interim method names have been removed, and the corresponding
functions have been removed from the intrinsic function sets.  

<ul>
  <li>getSuperclassList() is now Object.getSuperclassList()
  <li>isClass() is now Object.isClass()
  <li>propDefined() is now Object.propDefined()
  <li>propType() is now Object.propType()
  <li>length() is now List.length() and String.length()
  <li>sublist() is now List.sublist()
  <li>intersect() is now List.intersect()
  <li>car() and cdr() are now List.car() and List.cdr()
  <li>substr() is now String.substr()
  <li>toUpper() is now String.toUpper()
  <li>toLower() is now String.toLower()
  <li>find() is now List.find() and String.find()
  <li>toUnicode() is now String.toUnicode()
</ul>

This change will, of course, necessitate recompiling all code, and will
require changing code that calls any of the functions that have been
migrated to methods.  The sample code included in the distribution has
been updated to reflect the changes, and the documentation has also been
updated.

<li>Renamed the <tt>getSize()</tt> method in the Array class to
<tt>length()</tt>, for consistency with List and String.

<li>Added the 'is in' and 'not in' operators.  See
the <a href="sysman/expr.htm">"is in" and "not in" expressions</a>
section.

<li>The debugger now has "program arguments" settings.  You can
access these settings via a dialog, which you can open using the
"Program Arguments" item on the "Debug" menu.  You can use the
program arguments to control script file reading, output logging,
and the argument string that is passed to your program's "_main()"
entrypoint procedure.

<li>Added several new regular expression features: &lt;Case&gt; and
&lt;NoCase&gt;, &lt;Alpha&gt, &lt;Upper&gt;, &lt;Lower&gt;, &lt;Digit&gt;,
&lt;AlphaNum&gt;, &lt;Space&gt;, &lt;Punct&gt;.  Refer to the new
<a href="sysman/regex.htm">regular expressions section</a> of the documentation
for details.

<li>Enhanced the regular expression parser to detect and remove
cycles in compiled patterns.  It is possible (pretty easy,
actually) to introduce "infinite loops" into a pattern; the easiest
way to do this is to put a zero-or-more closure inside another closure,
as in "(.*)+" (this has an infinite loop because the expression in
parentheses can match zero characters, and that match can be repeated any
number of times), but much more complex and subtle types of cycles are
possible and can be inadvertantly constructed.  Eliminating the
infinitely repeating zero-length matches obviously doesn't change the
meaning of the expression, since one repetition of a zero-length match is
as good as a million, so the regular expression matcher simply detects
and removes these loops and then carries on as normal.

<li>Updated StartI3.t and StartA3.t (the starter games in the Workbench
kit) to work with _main.t, so you don't have to compile them with -nodef.
(This also has the benefit of making the files a whole lot simpler.)
Also updated them to use method calls rather than intrinsic function
calls where appropriate.

<li class=last>Updated the sample files to use the standard _main.t startup and
new property functions.

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<h3>Changes since 03/12/2000</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added <a href='t3dispfn.htm'>default display methods</a>, which
allow string display to be routed through a method of the active
"self" object in effect each time a string is displayed and each time
an expression embedded in a string via the &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; syntax
is displayed.  This powerful new feature allows for per-object output
filtering, and allows for "stateful" filtering (in that the filtering
function is a method of the object that initiated the filtering, and
can therefore look at properties of "self" to perform its work).

<li>Added the <a href='t3anonfn.htm#shortForm'>"short form" anonymous
function</a> syntax, which is much
more compact than the long form, but can only be used to define
functions that consist solely of a single expression.

<li>Added the <tt>subset()</tt> and <tt>applyAll()</tt> methods to
the <a href='t3array.htm'>array</a> and <a href="sysman/list.htm">list</a>
intrinsic classes.

<li>Added <a href="sysman/list.htm">documentation for the List intrinsic
class</a>.

<li>Added the <tt>-cs</tt> interpreter option, which allows the user
to specify a character set to use for the display and keyboard.
Refer to the new <a href='t3run.htm'>interpreter section</a> in
the documentation.

<li>As mentioned above, there is a <a href='t3run.htm'>new section
on the interpreter</a> in the documentation.

<li>The TADS 3 HTML interpreter and debugger for Windows now use a
separate registry key for storing their preference settings.  In
addition, the TADS 3 debugger's global preferences file is now
called HTMLTDB3.TDC.  These changes should allow TADS 2 and TADS 3
installations to co-exist independently on a single system, without
affecting one another's stored configuration settings.

<li>Anonymous function objects are now represented by their own
intrinsic class.  This is a mostly internal change, but does have
the benefit of enabling the debugger to display the type of an
anonymous function object (before, the debugger only knew that they
were objects).

<li>Made some internal changes to the way anonymous function context
objects are implemented to make them more efficient.  (In particular,
context objects are now arrays, not TADS objects; array index lookup
is faster than TADS object property lookup.)

<li>Moved the code to Visual C++ 6 (which involved no changes, not
surprisingly, although the new C++ compiler caught a few dubious
constructs and generated helpful warnings, all of which have been
cleaned up).

</ul>
