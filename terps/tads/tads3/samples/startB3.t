 *   This is a starter T3 source file.  This is designed for a project

 *   
 *   To compile this game in TADS Workbench, open the "Build" menu and
 *   select "Compile for Debugging."  To run the game, after compiling it,
 *   open the "Debug" menu and select "Go."
 *   
 *   This starter file is intended for people who want to use T3 to create
 *   projects that don't fall into the usual TADS 3 adventure game
 *   patterns, so it doesn't include any of the standard libraries.  If
 *   you want to create a more typical Interactive Fiction project, you
 *   might want to create a new project, and select the "introductory" or
 *   "advanced" option when the New Project Wizard asks you what kind of
 *   starter game you'd like to create.
